Pui Ying S.,2/27/09 3:55,1,0,0,0,4,"This place is super cute and has a nice rustic feel to it. It has actually a very small dining area and if you go as a couple, get the ""love table"", it's a little long table and you both sit on the same side.

We ate downstairs where the bar was and had just appetizers. The service was very good and attentive. The bread was warm, crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside. The artichoke pate was delicious and had lots of pickles, olives, and croutons. The squash soup was creamy, peppery. A+. 

They do catering and also have two large rooms that are for private parties. Look on the website they are very charming.

The decor is rustic, but the clientele is a little older and not as ""hip"".",233,11,#NAME?,"Washington, DC",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-dWrwBf7vq8GjztAb9K0Cg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/FBabo71m0V7Hv0Sdt9hy7A/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/c-and-o-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=
Elizabeth F.,1/18/11 0:48,0,0,0,0,5,"This is my favorite place in Charlottesville.  I have always loved eating here so much that C&O catered my wedding a few years back (Dave Simpson and company are absolute masters at event management).

This place has the whole package - exceptional food, exceptional service and atmosphere.  I especially enjoy sitting downstairs with the bar.",693,162,gxiBfTu1pzejwEsTZfFYaA,"Tuckahoe, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gxiBfTu1pzejwEsTZfFYaA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/OjYmWfE692NSGUWaE7YFqQ/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/c-and-o-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=
Jennifer M.,1/25/11 5:25,2,0,0,2,5,"****4.5 stars***

When better to stuff my face at places on my to go list than during Restaurant Week? C&O has been on my to go list of popular, high-rated dining experiences for a while now.

C&O is located at the end of the downtown mall a little past the Melting Pot in an antiquated building with what looks to be boarded up doors or windows or something in the front. When you enter, there is a small (by small I mean that it can fit 8-10 people) reception area with a fireplace. Beyond that, there is a dining space that looks like a long, narrow hallway. If you look closer though, you'll see that it is in fact a tiny room with a few tables cleverly reflected in a wall mirror. There is a bar off to another side room and an upstairs seating area as well.

While C&O definitely qualifies as fine dining, it aims to provide a comfortable atmosphere in it's traditional Virginia setting. Service was stellar and friendly (and thankful in one event) when I called several times on the phone as well as during our dinner.

To start, I had the arepa with braised pork, ricotta cheese, and pickled onions. This was an app that blew me away. The ricotta was housemade and not overpowering. The braised shredded pork was flavorful and tender. And I really liked the pickled red onions. Everything came together well on the arepa, a thick corn flour tortilla/bread, which may have been a little too thick as it tended to overpower some of the ingredients on top with its doughiness.

I had the bistro steak with sauce bordelaise. I do not think the cut of steak selected for the dish did it justice. Bistro steak tends to be soft on the outside but sinewy on the inside. However this cut of bistro steak may have been a little more sinewy than usual (only reason for 4.5 stars). Even with medium rare to avoid any toughness, I had a hard time cutting (much less chewing) this steak. As did others of my group. The outside had a nice smokey, seared flavor and went wonderfully with the red wine sauce and mashed potatoes (very flavorful with skin, the best kind of mashed potatoes) and some garlic sauteed asparagus (which were very fresh and young).

For dessert: the yummy Chocolate Pot de Creme. By this time, I was extremely full but I didn't want this excellent dessert to go to waste. It was not a rich chocolate and it had hints of cinnamon and/or nutmeg that made it unique and tasty.

Other notes: Crab and polenta looked tempting. Linguine with littleneck clams were housemade with beautiful coloring and thickness, served with whole large clam and not those dinky ones that come in canned soups. Creme brulee had beautiful looking and tasting caramelization, however the layer of custard itself was very thin. Cobblers came out piping hot and looked delicious.",497,459,V30Fh9_4AdsLdnl44GUg3A,"Kirkland, WA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=V30Fh9_4AdsLdnl44GUg3A,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ckdF6z9GN-kUQz2zt8D3pQ/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/c-and-o-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=
Dave W.,11/27/11 23:57,0,0,0,0,4,"This place came highly recommended - both from our hotel concierge, numerous pieces of printed material and many comments from people in the area. I can tell you, however, to ignore your first impression of the place - an old Pepsi sing hangs on the front of an older brick building, paint peeling from an old sign on the wall as well.

There was a film festival going on the weekend we were in town but we stopped in on a Friday to see if we could get a table somehow (everyone told us it would be impossible and they were right). The owner, David Simpson, was kind enough to give us a guided tour of the premises - up, down and outside. Everywhere we looked people seemed to be having a great time. We decided to try again before we left town.

Sunday night - we're in! David wasn't there but the hostess couldn't have been nicer and we were quickly seated in the downstairs dining room, which is also the bar.

Appetizers consisted of a House Salad for Carol and Local Chicken Soup with White Beans, topped with Chimichurri (fabulous). Entrees consisted of Blackened Alaska Salmon served with a sauteed potato/clam cake and buerre blanc. I had the Cuban Strip Steak with red onion Marmalade. Both entrees were excellent and the leftovers were nonexistent. 

Can't remember the wine we had with dinner but dessert for me consisted of a glass of Eades 17yr old Single Malt Speyside Scotch.

Wonderful place, great atmosphere and ambiance coupled with extremely attentive and outgoing staff.",909,292,0_NbnQy2AwOUDtDUr4uDTg,"Jackson, NJ",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0_NbnQy2AwOUDtDUr4uDTg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/UkvQzoO-Sihfv5hx-yynxw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/c-and-o-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=
Kimya P.,3/24/13 20:54,0,0,0,2,5,"Amazing - everything from service to food to atmosphere.  A little over $100 before tip for two appetizers, two entrees, and four cocktails.  Great value for high-quality ingredients and delicious flavors. 

For our appetizers, we had the boston lettuce salad with pommery mustard dressing and the buffalo mozzarella which came with mushrooms and greens.  For our entrees, my partner ordered the steak chinoise (the forkful of steak and mashed potatoes dipped in the ginger sauce more or less melted in my mouth!) and I had the lamb and gnocchi (my mouth waters just remembering the complex flavor combinations of this dish).  I would not hesitate to order all of these again.  Of the drinks, my favorite was their hot toddy made with black tea, bourbon, and plenty of cloves!

C&O is a tiny three story restaurant located off the downtown mall. The ambiance is romantic and classic (dark wood and brick walls, dim lighting, waiters and staff are dressed in black and looking good).  I would not hesitate to recommend the experience to locals and visitors - it was a perfect (and delicious) evening out!",327,104,vguybeVhVDGETEm68XzggQ,"Washington, DC",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=vguybeVhVDGETEm68XzggQ,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/u-VSByySfX4Ej-5ibj-JbA/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/c-and-o-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=
Han V.,3/25/13 18:51,4,2,2,5,2,"The old building gives a quaint, homey setting to your meal. Unfortunately, my group didn't feel very welcomed by the waitstaff here. We felt like they snubbed us for the entire time we were there. We were probably the youngest group in the place and I think they just wanted us to get out of there. 

As for their food--- it was all overpriced for average tasting food. I thought my beef was pretty tough and bland. My other friends were not wowed by their dishes either and it was a shame to spend $25+ on a dissatisfying meal.

Benjamin T.,4/3/14 18:03,1,0,0,1,5,"Been a few times and always happy with the experience. Whichever room you're sitting in is always a good time--though for a younger crowd recommend the lower room with the bar as there is a little more relaxed feel. 

In my most recent visit we started off with a special--the lobster risotto which was to die for and followed up by getting the strip. Kind of like there old Cuban steak which was a staple but it tastes like the same marinade and was delicious all the same. Homemade desserts left us almost in a food coma. 

Good wine list but it's fun to do cocktails--try some freshly squeezed greyhounds ""goose hounds"" or screwdrivers--delicious, very easy to drink which always makes dinner more fun.

Service friendly and knowledgable as well. Would definitely recommend.",11,2,AF0YhDoo_wpiAmWx0OrYIA,"Charlottesville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AF0YhDoo_wpiAmWx0OrYIA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/nR9NF9Ad3jVH3UHf828zsg/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/c-and-o-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=
Agnes L.,10/15/14 18:25,0,0,0,0,5,"Now that my husband (fellow Yelper Michal F.) and I have lived in Cville for a year, we know what our fav spots are: We came back to C&O for another special occasion - my birthday dinner. 

The setting is perfect for a date night as the ambiance is quiet, cozy and dimly lit. Plus, they tried to leave a few empty tables around us and other couples for privacy. Side note: Definitely call in advance for reservations, as they get booked and we had to take an earlier dinner.

We again ordered Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer, and it was just as I remembered it from the year before: High-quality meat with fresh arugula, salty parm and a crunchy hashed potato.

For our entrees: I got Bass with crab, while Michal got the Ribeye Steak with mushrooms and potatoes. Both were hearty, generous, filling and flavorful dishes. The fish was incredibly fork tender, yet had a crisp sear on the outside - cooked to perfection. The steak was cooked as Michal asked, medium rare, with his fav veggie that reminds him of his childhood in the woods of his grandfather's farm. We happily traded plates mid-meal to complete our own ""Surf and Turf.""

Dessert - Enjoyed a divine Marscapone Cheesecake. It was tiny but rich. I appreciated how there was no crust and just ""filling."" The server put a little candle in the middle for me to blow out - nice touch!

Flora L.,4/16/15 23:55,0,4,4,3,2,"My friend and I came to C&O for Farm to Table Restaurant Week. As much as we were excited to try thus restaurant, we were a little disappointed by the food. The appetizer we got was rabbit dish. The mushroom was very fresh and highlighted the taste of the fettuccine. However, as a former vegetarian for 2 years, the meat smelled and tasted too strong for me. The main dish featured chicken with asparagus. The chicken was wrapped in ham - not a good combination. Also the white sauce killed the freshness of the chicken. Finally the dessert. I got raspberry frisk. Too sweet and chuncky.
I would not come back again and would not recommend to friends. But then again, keep in mind that I came here for the restaurant week.",230,325,RhumBf8pXq3nv-oaPlw6FQ,"Seattle, WA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RhumBf8pXq3nv-oaPlw6FQ,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/0pwo-CGKhaZeNY62F2S-Ww/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/c-and-o-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=
David T.,1/25/16 20:05,2,2,2,3,4,"This is a fancy schmancy place.  High quality, high cost, great ambiance.  You take dates here to impress sort of place (in fact I'm pretty sure I was the only person here not on a date but I digress).  I was just visiting Charlottesville for work but I had been told by several friends I needed to check out C&O.  Fairly unassuming exterior, it feels like an old home thats been turned into a restaurant (which it probably has).  Fairly narrow interior, with tables upstairs and a narrow stair case near the entrance taking you down to the basement where there is the bar and some more tables.  

Service at the bar was prompt and polite.  Bartender made solid effort at conversation.  With a couple orders of red wine I got the veal appetizer and veal entree (I know, probably a tad excessive).  The dishes were prepared quite differently from each other and I thought they were good compliment with each other. The veal appetizer was amazing.  I wanted to lick the plate clean.  Just a wonderful carmelized flavor to it.  The veal was juicy and tender.  Im used to getting veal parmigian so it took me a second to realize that I hadn't gotten steak when it came out.  But it was very good.

Cheng X.,6/2/16 15:10,0,4,4,1,3,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday since I've always wanted to try this place. The atmosphere is...interesting. I get that they wanted to evoke a feeling of being in a train, but the place is cramped and we sat at a table downstairs where it was extremely dark. Luckily we came early so there were only one or two other occupied tables and thus not as noisy as some of the other reviews stated. We shared duck, lamb and ravioli dishes and for the most part I didn't really care for them - they were either a little salty or just alright. We got creme brulee for dessert and that was great but not really different than creme brulee in other places.

Parking can be an ordeal so plan ahead to allow yourself time to park if you have a reservation.

My favorite dishes were the duck breast with a blueberry reduction served with mashed sweet potatoes under a brussel sprout slaw. The gnocci with duck confit and butternut squash was also top-notch.

I was given a ticket for my coat check and appreciated it as I like it when a restaurant minds the small details!

The food was outstanding. Half of our party ordered the Chesapeake stripe bass which was so lovely and tender. The roasted mushrooms that accompany the bass are buttery and delicious! The lemon caper sauce has slivers of lemon that give you a surprising tart bite that can be a bit bright if you aren't expecting it.

Some others ordered the steelhead trout and really enjoyed it as well.

Dessert was very satisfying. The creme brûlée was rich and smooth. The chocolate bread pudding was dense, rich, and moist.

Upstairs is everything you'd think of with fine dining--white table cloth, full table setting, etc. The place to bring Mom for her birthday.

The complementary bread and butter were also incredible. My boyfriend got the lamb and gnocchi dish which was also very good! The lamb wasn't gamey tasting at all, which I liked. I got their signature item, the thinly sliced steak. The mashed potatoes it came with were to die for, but the sauce on the whole dish was a little too salty for me.

Kelly N.,7/29/17 20:35,1,1,1,0,3,"WARNING: If you get the pork tacos, they are EXTREMELY spicy.

Ok, now back to this regularly scheduled review. Let me give you some context to that first statement and start from the beginning. I was visiting in the Charlottesville. area and had been bar hoping all night in dire need of a meal (I had skipped dinner. When we finally got the opportunity to find a place to sit down for a meal at midnight, just about every place was closed. One of the servers at another restaurant recommended that the best place to go for late night for was C&O and she highly recommended the pork tacos. I mean HIGHLY recommended them. So what's a girl to do? Off we go to find C&O to get ourselves some pork tacos.

We finally find it down the strip and were seated at the bottom floor of the restaurant near the bar. Seems as if they were going to be closely soon, too, so we needed to get our orders in quickly. Two of us at the table went with the pork tacos (we do as were told), and someone else went with the cheeseburger. The late night bar menu is really limited, so there wasn't much else to select from that could opt as a meal.

The pork tacos finally arrive and in my hazy, tipsy state, I go head first! I take my first bite and get slammed with a mouthful of flavors. Overall, the taco was really delicious, but I couldn't grab my glass of water fast enough. These are some SERIOUSLY spicy tacos. I'm not one to shy away from spice, I like it somewhere in the middle between getting my tongue burnt off and feeling the tingle. I was truly shocked at how hot these tacos were and I had no warning signs to let me know. The woman who recommended the place/tacos didn't mention anything. The waiter who took my order didn't mention anything. Most of all, the menu didn't say a single mention that these tacos were spicy. Nothing. 

Overall, I was only able to get through 2 of the 3 tacos before my mouth had to call it quits. I wouldn't say I left hungry, but I definitely didn't leave satisfied. I mentioned before, the tacos actually had the potential to be really delicious if they weren't so overpowered by the unexpected spice factor.

Ok, rant over, but just a heads up for anyone who orders this dish - you better like your tacos spicy.",129,141,IsY7gaSF7Xc2S3tDOu8H7Q,"New York, NY",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=IsY7gaSF7Xc2S3tDOu8H7Q,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/VZVwbXmgRRfEDznQXSOWaw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/c-and-o-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=

The fig appetizer with gorgonzola, gnocchi and duck and ravioli were so good. For the main course, the NY Strip with mushrooms, well let's just say there was nothing left on my plate and I thought I was done there. However, I made room for the chocolate bread pudding AMAZING!!!!!!!!

They first started us off on some bread and butter. The rolls were soft and warm while the butter was a bit saltier than expected. We ordered the roast sea scallops and the French onion soup for our appetizers.  The scallops were amazing and the sauce that it was served with was so flavorful.Then, we ordered the steak chinoise and chicken roulade for our entree. They were good, but they weren't very impressive in my opinion. To my surprise, the dessert was probably the star of the dinner. I fell in love with the strawberries and creams.  My partner got the chocolate bread pudding. Considering how we aren't the biggest fans of dessert, we really enjoyed their desserts. They weren't too heavy nor sweet. The plating for all our dishes were beautiful as well. 

The service here was incredible. They were very responsive and quick in bringing our foods right after we finish the ones before.

Amy K.,1/29/18 15:13,0,1,1,0,4,"Thank you C&O for a wonderful time. We had a reservation for 5:30 pm on a Saturday night, and C&O was very accommodating for our party of 5. We were seated upstairs, which is a small, but intimate space. The service was attentive and polite thoughout the entire meal, which was appreciated.

The food was well-presented, but I found some of the dishes too strong for me. I started off with the pear and pecorino ravioli, which was on the heavier side for a first course. The butter sauce was overwhelming, and overpowered the other flavors. I wasn't able to finish the dish because at one point, I felt like I was just consuming butter. I did try my friend's roasted sea scallops, which were flavorful and delicious. 

For the next course, I had the braised retreat farm lamb. The lamb did not have a gamey taste, but was a little salty. I'm glad it came with gnocchi to break up the taste, but still found myself reaching for the complimentary bread in between bites. 

Finally, I got the Meyer lemon creme brulee for dessert, which was definitely my favorite course. The creme brulee was smooth and fantastic! The huckleberry sauce adds a nice tart flavor. 

With beautiful dishes and generous portions for just $35, C&O is definitely one of the best Restaurant Week deals in Charlottesville.

Right level of dim lighting but not too dark. 

Drawbacks: air conditioning was acting up. They turned it on and off throughout the night. When it was on it was too cold (can't they simply adjust it for a comfortable level?). When it was off it became muddy and too warm.

Harlan M.,3/7/19 11:40,1,0,0,0,4,"If not for the parking (now a short walk to the garage and they validate) this would easily be a 5 star review. The ambiance screams historic building and when you enter you're greeted by a warm and cozy wood-burning stove. Our party of 6 was escorted to the downstairs dining area tucked near the bar. The walls are unique wood panels and some even have hinges that make it seem like hidden areas are behind them (prohibition era stuff maybe?)

The food was amazing, no one at my table was disappointed with their selections. But be ready to open your wallet. I'm very guilty of buyer's remorse especially in this situation of three dollar signs, I was so happy with my entree of Duck Breast. My expectations were high of course! Others ordered two appetizers and had it served as their meal so that's obviously an option as well. I did tell someone in my party that it was the most I have ever enjoyed duck. Great flavors as the sweet potato, smoked bacon and apple hash interplayed with the richness of the duck. I was excited to try the huckleberry gastrique since I've never had huckleberries before. It had a sweeter flavor and very enjoyable on my pallet. A very nice drink selection as well, plenty of craft beers and wines to chose from.

Abe K.,5/6/19 20:10,0,0,0,0,5,"My partner and I almost regretted stuffing ourselves with delicious cocktails at Alley Light because we couldn't eat as much as we wanted here at C&O. We ended up with just a few appetizers: seared scallops, bibb salad, beef carpaccio, duck confit. I've reviewed each dish from least favorite to most. (I'd recommend all the dishes though)

Duck confit: The ricotta gnocchi was delicious and plumply stuffed making it quite heavy. While the duck jus and duck confit were cooked to perfection, the duck jus definitely added to the heaviness of the dish, as expected. While we cleaned the plate, it was most difficult to scarf down. 

Bibb salad: My partner loved it. I thought it was small, even as an appetizer. Flavor was there but it was simply 7 leaves. 

Seared scallops: I put this 2nd best only because of the very minor nuances. The scallops are always tricky because if it's just slightly overcooked, the middle becomes chewy. These scallops were perfectly seared but slightly too salty. Combined with the cauliflower puree, the salt hid a bit but the cauliflower puree had some sour milk to it too so that was a little strange.

Beef carpaccio: Found no flaw in this. The greens that came with it were so deliciously dressed and came with very thin slices of raw beef. 

Service was excellent as was the ambiance.

Cami J.,5/22/19 17:32,0,2,2,0,1,"This one star is for a Manager, not for food.
   My family and I ate at the C&O after my son's graduation and we had a very nice and delicious meal, probably one of the best ones we've had in a long time. 
   After our meal, my daughter asked if we could ask for a flower from the table to leave at the Heather Heyer Memorial on the street on our way back to the parking lot. (I'm attaching a picture of the very small vase and flowers at our table.) I said I would ask.
   I approached a group of people by the bar and asked a server if we could take one flower and I explained why we were requesting it. She said she did not think there would be a problem, but she had to ask the manager, she then turned to a lady next to her and asked her, the lady then turned to me and after I explained again what I wanted she said that ""We still have two more services and if you'd like flowers, there is a very nice shop downtown at 4th street, etc., etc, and I'm sure they'd be happy to sell you all the flowers you'd like"".
   This response really turned me off after the nice meal we had just had. We had just paid for a $70.00dll/a person meal plus drinks and this lady manager had no qualms about sending us downtown for a flower. 
   Sometimes you have to use your judgement and think that a flower (Lily of the Incas, not expensive at all!!!) is not worth losing some potential clients, especially after these customers have just paid a good amount of money for your product.
   I wrote to the management, and the owner of the restaurant apologized and expressed his shock (his words) at the reaction to my request. He said in his email that he would take appropriate action and that's it. I have not heard from them and I don't know if I'll be back there. 
   Sad ending to a perfect meal.

Alice M.,6/7/19 3:51,3,0,0,5,4,"C & O late night is my favorite meal in Cville!! I love the grilled cheese and tomato soup so much, but as Zhana mentioned it is a big portion and might be better for sharing depending on how hungry you are. Usually I love their burger as well, though sometimes it can be inconsistent-- I've had some that were pretty burnt. They recently changed to their summer burger (lettuce, tomato, jalapeño aioli) which I like less than the winter burger (I think it has cheese and onions/mushrooms) but it is nice that they keep it seasonal. 

I've had a few of their cocktails and while they are pretty good, you're just as well off ordering your favorite fancy cocktail (dirty gin martini on the rocks for me) because the bartenders are very competent. I like the ambiance in here-- dimly lit and sexy. Makes me feel classier than I am! 

The food at dinner is also great though definitely more expensive than late nite. The dining room upstairs is nicer than the main floor but I also like the terrace out back. In particular I recommend the steak chinoise which has been on their menu since they opened. The sauce it comes with is super unique and delicious as well! Definitely recommend closing out the meal with the chocolate bread pudding for dessert-- it's to die for!

Our mains were ribeye involtini (perfect cook, lots of flavor) and duck confit (great crispy skin, cleared the whole plate).

The only thing we were disappointed in was the dessert. The sticky pudding was crunchy on the outside like it was overcooked. I had a peaches and ice cream dessert and the peaches were not ripe at all. There was no flavor and they were so hard that it was difficult to eat.

I believe the menu was a special curation, but each course, from salad to ravioli to chocolate cake, was outstanding. Their wine selection was also on point, with a high quality red and white flowing throughout the evening.

Brooke L.,12/18/19 21:31,0,0,0,0,5,"C and O Restaurant was the first restaurant we tried here in Charlottesville, and we were definitely not disappointed by this gem. From ther moment we walked in to the comforting wood fire and friendly service, we had a pleasant experience. We loved the cozy, historical atmosphere, sitting upstairs by a wreathed window overlooking the railroad (where it gets its name). 

The food was amazing! We have lived in Northern California for about 8 years and have become spoiled by their food options. When visiting the east coast, we do not often find food up to that caliber, but C and O definitely did. We started with a light salad with a dressing that I would love to replicate. Next, along with the awesome shaved brussels, we had the trout and duck entrees; both were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. To finish, I got a cheese plate and my husband got a chocolate treat. It was all amazing. The service was impeccable with great attentiveness. The staff members were all so kind and very welcoming. We were even given a mini ""tour"" to see the lively bar in the basement.

Cristina W.,1/27/20 18:16,2,0,0,3,5,"Finally came to check out C&O for this year's restaurant week - and it did not disappoint!  Restaurant is small, and seating is limited - but they fully utilize all three levels of the small historic building they are located in.  It is January - and cold.  I do think the restaurant was not super well insulated - so if you run cold, bring an extra sweater.

Service is exceptional.  From coat check, to check in, to meal - everything was top notch.  Parking is validated in the Market St and Water St garages - bringing the parking fee down to $1! Such a wonderful convenience.

Now the food is excellent.  To start, I had the beef carpaccio - which I would reorder in an instant.  Thin sliced beef with a nice creamy sauce thin layer and dressed with a lovely arugula and parmesan cloud of delight.  My main was the duck confit- and it was savory and delicious.  It is hearty but not super gamey.  My dinner partner got the lamb cassoulet and it was an equally hearty more ragout style.  Dessert was a little disappointing for me - I got the sticky toffee pudding and found it underwhleming.  The cake was a burnt on the bottom, and the toffee sauce was excessively sweet.  Creme Fraiche though was on point.  the cheese dish was so tasty - I might consider making that my dessert next time.  A great combo of creamy and stinky - the cheese selection was absolute fire.

The atmosphere here feels more upscale, with a nice warm fire greeting you during colder months. There's seating for dinner both upstairs and downstairs. It's small place so I'd recommend asking for upstairs seating if possible--you get more room.

The waiters here are great--have never had an issue with an inattentive waiter or  long waits for apps or between apps and main courses and I've come with party sizes between 4 and 8.

Entrees: had to get the duck confit and the farm lamb cassoulet. Overall, I will say that these were similar dishes - savory, filling, and strong on the flavors. Nothing was mild or subtle!

Al T.,5/6/20 23:19,0,0,0,1,5,"Note: I'm writing this review during the statewide sars-cov-2 closures.

C&O is my favorite restaurant in Charlottesville, has been for many years. Later, I can write lovingly about the ambience and service, etc. For now, I want to focus on the pandemic takeout experience. In short, it's perfect.

They offer a changing takeout menu each week, with some a la carte options. You can order online, then pick up the next evening. You just pull up in front and they'll ask your name, and bring your order out. You don't even have to get out of the car, thus very limited exposure. And you can tell they're taking it seriously: gloves, mask, hand sanitizer, etc. It's all smooth and professional.

We've been ordering once a week or so, and I've been amazed at how well the food travels. Even my favorite delicate dish, the pan fried trout (amandine), reheats beautifully in a warm oven. Ricotta gnocchi with duck confit, striped bass, sticky toffee pudding, etc. - most of my favorite dishes rotate in eventually and have been excellent. 

The price is fairly high, for our food budget at least, but given the quality of the food and generous portions of the sides, salad, and dessert that come with each meal - I think it's a great value. We are certainly delighted with it and plan to keep ordering regularly.",11,2,gBHHYU7mJDU36jFAMMq1Kg,"Charlottesville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gBHHYU7mJDU36jFAMMq1Kg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/5KKS6vx7XtsmKxFDLOCNAg/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/c-and-o-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=

Mallory H.,2/15/21 19:12,0,0,0,1,5,"Went here last night for Valentine's Dinner. We started with drinks- a Cosmopolitan for me and a Banana Standard (Rye) for the significant other. The drinks were delicious and great prices. As for food, they're serving a 3-course meal for $68 per person. They had great options for all 3 courses- I didn't feel like I was having to settle as multiple items from each course sounded delicious. 

For my appetizer, I got the Hamachi Crudo. It was very fresh and plentiful. There was a sweet sauce on top that cut into the fattiness. My SO got the russet potato gnocchi with king crab. It was a $12 upcharge. I wish it was a little bigger portion or had more crab, but besides the size it was fantastic taste. There was an incredible sauce that really brought it all together. For the entrees, I got the duck breast and he got the steak chinoise. Both were delicious and plenty big enough, but WOW his steak was out of this world. I was nervous the tamari ginger sauce on it would be overpowering but it melded perfectly with the steak. The potatoes (on both dishes) were buttery in texture and delicious in taste. Lastly, for dessert we got the chocolate pavé and coconut gateau. As I'm not a big  sweet person (and at that point already very full), I didn't rage over either but nonetheless had no complaints. 

All in all this was a wonderful experience. The service was great, food was delicious, and felt as though the quantity and quality of the food we got fulfilled the price we paid.

Jade R.,4/3/21 1:03,3,5,5,5,2,"Honestly it sucks to write this but in many ways I'm very upset. I saw that this place had excellent reviews. Some of them said they weren't ""creative"" or stellar but nobody outwardly said it was bad. I just wanted to give my honest experience for those whose entire days can be ruined by a bad meal.

My family is visiting from Florida and I wrote up a full Charlottesville itinerary. It was their first trip here so I wanted it to be special. I was between Fleurie and C&O for tonight and WISH I picked Fleurie. The menu seemed strong, but boy was the food not good (at least for me).

I started with a glass of wine and the new pasta special. I LOVE pasta, especially house made. It was honestly awful. It just didn't taste right. When the best feature of a dish is... English peas, something isn't right. It had an awful sauce and didn't TASTE like the description. My brother had the beef carpaccio and raved about it and my mom had the scallops and they were excellent. I'm glad they were happy but it was honestly one of the worst dishes I've ever had. I had high hopes for my entree since the waitress (who was honestly amazing otherwise) recommended it. I had the lamb and my brother and mom had the halibut. The lamb was criminally bad. It had... another gross sauce on it. It was almost drowned in this sauce. It was served over a bland polenta. I haven't had many lamb dishes I didn't like, but this one was hard to eat. This time, my family said the halibut was severely overcooked but the sauce was delicious. For dessert I had the creme brûlée and it was good. My brothers cheese plate looked like airline food.

Overall... beauty atmosphere, stellar service, but I spent over $100 for awful food. Very upsetting. Maybe I ordered wrong or something but I don't care to go back and find out.

We were seated in an area on the first floor that was outside but at some point was enclosed. It was a very nice and romantic ambience. It was not cold at all. We were very comfortable.

Nate K.,9/2/21 11:39,1,0,0,1,5,"C&O is the staple when you search for the lists of Cville's best restaurants, so it was a no-brainer for us to book a reservation during a few days staying in the area. The restaurant is eclectic with a dark and moody bistro downstairs and an airy, more homey upstairs. I expected people to be dressed a little more tastefully but most guys weren't even wearing collared shirts, it seemed. 

We went all out and got cocktails, apps, entrees and desserts each and it goes without saying -- everything, everything, everything was delectable. My wife ate the seared tuna and she will never touch raw(ish) fish like that, and here she is trying to take more pieces. I got the steak chinoise and naturally it was incredible with the ginger-tamari bearnaise. I love high dollar steak but compared to the simplicity of a nice filet, it is elevated when you have a steak that you can just mop up plate sauce with. 

My wife ordered the duck confit app as an entree which is fitting it comes out looking like an entree. That's the one weird thing that stuck out with us - why is this on the app menu? How is this supposed to be shareable? Regardless the ducks fall apart and the ricotta gnocchi are perfect.

B R.,12/22/21 21:37,0,0,0,3,3,"Let's me start this by saying We love C&O.  The ""we"" is my wife and I.   We live Downtown and have a wide selection of restaurants from which to choose and definitely have our favorites.  C&O always makes that list even though we frequent it less often than many others.  It's pricier for one and harder to get a table for another.  So, all of that said, we hadn't been in since Covid started and were excited to go back last week.  The charm is still there.  The downstairs bar is our favorite, feels like a different world in a good way.  And the wait staff is lovely and attentive.   My main issue - and the reason for the 3-star review - is that the food has slipped significantly while the prices have risen dramatically.  Menu has changed - plenty of favorites now gone.   My Rockfish was OK - but swimming in Sweet Potato (roasted fall squash according to the menu) to the point that the flavor of the dish was basically sweet potato pie.  I scraped 2/3's of it off and it still was overwhelmed with 'squash'.    $42 for a small piece of rockfish and a can of sweet potato.  The prices here are competing with NYC prices. But the food isn't keeping up.  I worry that regulars are going to get priced out.  I understand Covid has changed the game for restaurants - it's incredibly hard to hire good staff, food prices and inflation are going in the wrong direction, the lingering fear of the pandemic has decimated traffic.  How to survive?  I don't have the answer.  But when we think of going out for dinner next time, C&O will be off the short list b/c I just don't feel like paying $40+ for mediocre piece of fish or $50 for a decent but unexceptional piece of steak.  Breaks my heart to write this but I feel like it's a matter of time before the equation for what makes C&O such an incredible place gets decimated.

The cocktails were really sweet and not unique. Like, if you're only doing the classics, then make them perfect. The arugula salad with warm goat cheese was good--but it's also hard to mess up heating up cheese. The roasted scallops were pretty good too, and I was happy with them, but not the best I've ever had. The duck confit gnocchi was where we were REALLY disappointed.

My criticism are small, just like their portions, but definitely expect to pay $$$$ for appetizers, dinner, and drinks. Their entrées start at $37. The scallops are $24 and there are 4, maybe 5 total so I do NOT recommend that dish. But their beef tartare is some of the best in town. Drinks on the menu or off, their bartender will make it delicious! It is a little off the mall so you can park a bit down the street and walk. Pre-pandemic they had late night C&O which was a great post date or night out nightcap. The prices were much more affordable but the standards and taste was just as good. I hope they bring that back.

Came here for Dinner Friday May 20

Service was poor. Note this was no surprise as you've known for a year this would be a busy nights

Bar - bartender was very very very slow 

Fresh bread was stale (warmed up) and so hard I almost cracked a tooth. 

 ++ Appetizer- salmon, pasta and carpaccio were excellent 

++ Main - duck (fair) , tenderloin and lamb very good with tender and deep flavors

- - - Potatoes and asparagus were cold, ice cold!!

+ Dessert was good, toffee pudding was extraordinary, creme brûlée was pre made, dark chocolate bread pudding was okay

- - - - Service was disappointing (server she took our order and never came back) some other guy serving water who we'd not seen at all came up 75% through our meal and asked how our meal was...kinda a fly by.

- I ordered a second round of drinks that took 14 minutes (meal was over) server never came back!!

For a big celebration we had a good time but not without distractions you created that could easily have been avoided!

The highlight of the night for me was the crab cake. This was hands down the best crab cake I have ever tried. So much flavor and they did not skimp on the crab meat. I love the sauce and tomato garnish. The sticky toffee cake was my second favorite dish. The flavor was cinnamony, rich and indulgent. The salmon was pretty good but nothing too memorable.

We started off with some bread and butter which was pretty good. We ordered 2 appetizers to share which were the butternut squat ravioli and the braised retreat farm lamb. Everything came out great and the lamb was a treat to eat. The butternut squash was amazing too. We got cocktails as well and I did not like mine but the server had no problem with exchanging it for something I enjoyed. The only reason why I left a star out was because we were waiting for our server to come back and offer us dessert but we had to ask someone else. It took awhile for him to come back to us.

Stephanie B.,5/15/23 16:09,0,0,0,1,4,"Dined in for an early meal Saturday night, first time here. There wasn't any street parking nearby so parked in a paid lot a few blocks away. We were seated upstairs which I would call a ""grandmas house"" vibe. Cream colored walls with landscape paintings, white tablecloths and wooden chairs with woven straw seats. I was in the corner beside a large glass window that was parallel to someone's apartment who also had a large glass window. We were maybe 40' from each other? A straight line of sight between the person on his couch and me at the dinner table. Somewhat uncomfortable but not a deal breaker. The menu had a variety of offerings and we settled on the tuna crudo app, halibut for me and salmon for my partner. The tuna was delicious, great use of herbs/olive oil to flavor. The halibut was just ok. It was drenched in a lemon butter sauce, like when you hit the bottom of a ketchup bottle and it empties onto your plate. I scraped off what I could to get a taste of the fish, which was good. There was also what the waiter called a relish on the plate as well but it tasted like a chunky spaghetti sauce. The flavor didn't pair well with the lemon butter, seemed like two opposing tastes. My guy enjoyed his salmon. It was supposed to be potato crusted but only 1/3 of the top of the fish was covered. We skipped dessert as we were pressed for time to get somewhere else. The service was great and made up for the disappointment of my meal. Now that I've dined I would definitely go again but next time ask for any sauces on the side if possible and to sit downstairs where it's a low-lit sexier vibe where you don't run the risk of eating across from someone on their couch.

Cynthia E.,9/9/23 23:32,2,2,2,2,5,"I was drawn to this restaurant by the Duck Confit dish. When I saw it, I knew it was going to be delicious and it was! The ricotta, the duck, the cracklins, the sauce. It all worked together so well. It was a perfect portion and temperature. Not too hot so you could immediately begin eating. Also mild flavors - not too savory. I loved it.

I also had the crème brûlée. Nice hard top and creamy consistency underneath. I could see the vanilla seeds too. Nice fruit pieces on top.

The server was really nice too. He let me sample one of the beers before I purchased it and checked in on me throughout my time there.

The outside of the restaurant looks like an old house. It has three floors and the bottom floor didn't get much light, but it provided a nice ambiance and also had the bar.

Jerry G.,10/30/23 16:38,0,0,0,0,4,"First visit to C&O. Lots of reviews and praise so thought I'd give it a shot. Restaurant is quaint which is a code word for small both in footprint and menu choices. And it can get noisy. Had a table on the upper level. Tables are spaced adequately but the open ceiling creates a sometimes noisy environment. Appetizer of Shishito Peppers which was good but could have been better without what I believe was garlic aioli. Companion had Salmon and rated it as outstanding. Nice, slightly crispy outside while translucent in the interior. Not over cooked. I had the Steak Chinois. Wasn't blown away. Cut of beef was good and although sliced at presentation, was a bit tough. Still it was cooked as I requested. I felt the sauce atop took away from the meat's taste and it somewhat ""buried"" the steak.  Desert of Sticky Toffee Pudding was served warm.  It was good but not something I'd order again.  The menu at C&O is, as noted, somewhat small but to be expected given the quality of the food and presentation.  Prices are no worse than any other fine dining restaurant.  Would I return?  Maybe for a special occasion.

John B.,2/17/24 4:06,0,0,0,0,3,"The ambiance was sublime, the wine perfect. The service was attentive and pleasant throughout. This restaurant is a local favorite and for good reason. Here's the thing: You need to like creamy dishes. Sorry, I mean you need to LOVE creamy dishes. The Steak Chinois is soaking in sauce. The duck breast special was delightful, but glazed to within an inch of its, er, life. We like to see the protein shine through on its own, but here every beef, duck, and (I'm assuming from the menu description) lamb is drenched in a tasty if over-applied sauce. This reminds me of Julia Child's American invasion. Of what we thought French food was 30 years ago. Even the Brussel Sprouts did laps through an aioli sauce. Everything seems to ride atop a bed of puree - be it potato or cauliflower or whatever. The meat was cooked perfectly, the dishes were tasty. But the overwhelming presence of a cream note to nearly everything on the menu (from reading, we only tried two)? 

Again, if you like saucy dishes, this is your Eden. 

We would love to come back when the sauce to protein/vegetable is more balanced. We are new to the area, and this approach seems to be working for this gem of a location - but goodness this was rich.

Alison M.,5/3/24 18:26,4,1,1,7,4,"I found this interesting-looking restaurant online and booked it for my birthday dinner with my mom and her fiancee while we were in town.

We arrived at 8:30pm for their last seating (only reservation I could get) and were seated downstairs by the door next to a table of three men drinking wine and being loud.  The manager came over and asked if I'd like to move upstairs bc she knew I'd requested a quiet table.  That was great.  I appreciated that.

So we moved upstairs to a much quieter table by the window.

It went downhill after that.  Our server was french or something and he was rude.  It took a LONG time for him to come take our drink orders and when he asked if we wanted wine I said no and my mom ordered a tea.  He then asked if we were all OK with water and I said, let me see the drink menu, while I was looking, he simply walked away.  He didn't ask my husband or my mom's fiancee what they wanted.  We were like, what? 

My husband went to hunt him down and he came back and I said, just because we hadn't ordered wine didn't mean we didn't want something else to drink.  I ordered a tea and they ordered a beer and bourbon.  

After about 10 minutes I asked him where my tea was and he said ""Maybe I would get it"".  I was pissed, he was rude about it and you could tell he was trying to be a smart ass.  I realize bar drinks take a minute - but this was sweet tea and he was clearly catering to all his other tables and ignoring ours. 

I was pissed and planned to tell him off about how rude he had been from the start and exactly what we had done to offend him when I was trying to have a nice birthday dinner with my mom who I never see.  It's pricey to eat here - with entrees around $35-50 each and I don't want to be talked down to  or treated badly by servers when I've been nothing but polite.  I used to wait tables so I am a generous tipper and try to be mindful of asking for too much or try to give advance notice. 

The food was actually very good.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I had the potato encrusted salmon, my mom ordered the halibut, and my husband had their signature steak steak dish and I thought it was the best dish of the night.

They have a nice dessert menu and I saw several things I wanted to try but I went with the sticky toffee pudding in the end and it was very good.  They put a little candle on it for my birthday.

The saving grace was the same manager who helped me in the beginning, she brought us bread when I spoke to her and asked if they were out and had the kitchen heat up a little something else.  Our server didn't even try. 

My husband informed her of the issues we'd had and she was clearly appalled - she handled it very well and ended up comping the entire meal.  Rare.  Not what we expected at all...

It's nice inside with a cool vibe, the food was delicious and the manager was a 10. So, we'd come back again despite the rude server who almost ruined my bday dinner.",3183,648,ZXOxl4oyBa4JTN3hPbnYyw,"Virginia Beach, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZXOxl4oyBa4JTN3hPbnYyw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/jIb_zTm-biZSNGUwH4R9tw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/c-and-o-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=

For my entree, I got the duck confit and ricotta gnocchi. I was hesitant to get this since I don't typically order duck, but the waitress promised it was delicious. Sure enough, this was a memorable dish! The duck was so tender and roasted in a sauce that was flavorful and not overly salty. The ricotta gnocchi was a great accompaniment to the dish. My only wish is that there was more- I think there were only 4 or 5 total. My husband tried the crab cake and bolognese. I'm glad he got two dishes because one certainly wouldn't have filled him up. The crab cake was not skimpy on the crab and was paired with a nice sauce. The bolognese pasta was also pretty tasty. We ended the meal with creme brûlée. While it was pretty good, I've had better.

Visit: October 2023

Shenandoah National Park in Virginia is one of the top spots in the United States to enjoy fall foliage, and my wife Jun and I had visited the park on a road trip every fall since we moved to the DC area. While we stayed at different places around the park, we had not visited Charlottesville where the University of Virginia is located until this year. When we finalized our plan to stay overnight in Charlottesville in late October last year after driving through the stunning Skyline Drive, I was looking for a restaurant to grab dinner. C&O, which had long been one of the most beloved institutions in the town, appeared in all of the several ""where to dine in Charlottesville"" lists I had found online. After our dinner at the restaurant, we both agreed that C&O is a solid choice for those visiting Charlottesville.  

The menu at C&O features classic dishes with French countryside influence. There won't likely to be a dish you hadn't seen before, but that doesn't mean the execution from the kitchen was overall good. We started with skillfully pan roasted scallops with whipped cauliflower, and shared a couple of main dishes in duck confit on top of ricotta gnocchi and grilled lamb chops. Jun, who has high standard when it comes to duck dishes, praised the duck confit as above average, and I thought the lamb chops (which came with mint salsa verde and potato puree) were grilled quite nicely. If you have room for dessert after savory dishes, I highly recommend trying a few at C&O. We both savored the vanilla crème brulee with enthusiasm, and the wild huckleberry sundae with caramelized pistachios was also wonderfully delightful.   

When we entered the restaurant, Jun and I were surprised to find white tablecloth on dining tables; we just hadn't expected a more formal dining experience, especially given the somewhat modest look of the exterior. If you are looking for a romantic dinner, I recommend asking the staff to be seated at the back of the dining room with candlelit tables. The wine list was another pleasant surprise at C&O where you will find an expansive group of bottles at varying prices from different parts of the world. If you are driving to the restaurant, you can park your car at a public parking garage nearby (the restaurant offers parking validation). While we have yet to fully understand or embrace what life in the Virginia countryside is like, I feel C&O quite adequately captures the culture and ethos of the region with soulful dishes that may not dazzle you like a Michelin star fine dining restaurant does but will nevertheless make you smile with satisfaction.",721,562,PYbjreZpONNMp25uRSPB-A,"Washington, DC",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=PYbjreZpONNMp25uRSPB-A,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/u_joiKmwviiMVnLsJGjC1w/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/c-and-o-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=
