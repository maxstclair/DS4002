2023-02-19,5.0,"This place was better than the 3 Michelin-star restaurant I ate at in NYC last week (not naming names). They've only been open only 3 days and already seem to have everything on lock. We had an ""early bird special"" reservation at 5PM on a Saturday and were greeted by a lovely host and seated immediately. I'm pretty sure the Guardians of the Galaxy station was what was playing on the speakers (that alone gives extra points ;)). Our server, Zoe, was perfectly attentive and super knowledgeable about the available cuts of meats. The menu was very diverse for the entrees however the only gripe I have is that the starters were limited. We ordered the roasted oysters to start and OMG the BEST roasted oysters I've ever had. They were cooked to perfection and super tender. My husband and I shared the ribeye and ordered the Raymond Sauce and Chimichurri for side sauces. We loved both so much that we're still in the octagon to decide the winner ;). The ribeye was amazingly flavorful, and the sauces were a lovely accouterment but seriously not even needed due to the quality of the meat and the perfection of the cooking/seasoning. The steak comes with a house salad and baguette that arrives before your entree. We also ordered the creamed spinach which was another ""best"". Seriously. Not too creamy/heavy, just overall DELICIOUS. Our server was the perfect amount of checking in and making suggestions. Oh and did I mention they have a super knowledgeable sommelier and a delightful wine list. We also ordered dessert with the french press coffee. I'm not a dessert person, but the lemon pie was chef's kiss.  

All in all, we will definitely be back and can't wait to try all the other delicious sounding items on the menu.",82.0,Black Cow
2023-02-19,5.0,"I have to say, this place is a steakhouse like no other, best beef and my bone in pork chop and sauce was fabulous. We sat up at the bar and Danny & Emily took care of us at every beckon request. I do feel that this place is a diamond in the rough, it should be the place for beef, pork & chicken. Love the atmosphere, staff, cooks & owner Dan! Thank you!",113.0,Black Cow
2023-02-26,5.0,"Loved this place! They were completely booked but they squeezed us in in the lounge. Thank you! This restaurant was just what we were looking for on our short visit from CA.
Steak was awesome. Shared the Chateaubriand and my son had the ribeye (both with butter on top.) steaks came with dinner salad and sourdough bread.
Mashers were super rich and delicious. Brussels sprouts were crispy and flavorful.  Desserts- lemon pie (like a lemon square as it had shortbread crust), vanilla ice cream and chocolate mousse (if you like dark chocolate) all were awesome too.  Service was excellent.
Make a reservation in advance.",28.0,Black Cow
2023-05-03,4.0,"Food is excellent, best steak in a very long time. Service was excellent, attentive, helpful but not overbearing.  Ambiance was eating in a very loud garage, so only reason it was not a solid 5 star.",24.0,Black Cow
2023-08-03,5.0,"The food here is incredible! The service was extremely friendly and helpful. We felt right at home and very well accommodated. 

I will say, the height of the booths along the back wall is *extremely* uncomfortable and overall, fairly inaccessible if one has any sort of limitation mobility-wise. Initially we were seated there. The tables were awkwardly high for the height of the seats (which was already not great), and the edge of the table was up to my chest which made it hard to comfortably eat. However, our server was able to move us into a normal height table when he saw that all of the people in our party were struggling. Another thing to note is that the restaurant is fairly loud. This didn't bother me much, but I can imagine that if one is sensitive to that it could be bothersome. Just something to note if one is seeking a quieter dining experience. This place is full of life!

The food was AMAZING. Delicious wood fired oysters, steaks with flavor-packed compound butter and optional sauces, delightfully crispy fries, and perfectly cooked vegetables. The drinks were delightful as well. I thoroughly look forward to coming back!!",23.0,Black Cow
2023-03-19,5.0,"Wow! Mouth watering steak (excuse the spilled Bernaise sauce). Tender, perfectly cooked filet. Others at the rib end tomahawk, Berkshire pork chop, and New York strip.  No one shared because our meals were too good! For wides we did mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and Brussels sprouts.  The creamed spinach was gone.  The Brussels sprouts were the kind you think about the next day and crave.  The potatoes were good. Extensive wine list and full bar.  Everything is a La carte though so it added up.  Entrees come with a salad but no other sides.  There's also bread service.  10/10 highly recommend if you're looking for a nice night out.  The food is delicious!!!!",165.0,Black Cow

2023-03-23,5.0,The food was absolutely delicious. I had a perfectly cooked ribeye with the chimichuri sauce and the truffle mac and cheese. It was fantastic! I'd also recommend the cocktails (Smoky Dove with jalapeno salt ring! Yum!) The happy hour was a great price for all that deliciousness..,2.0,Black Cow
2023-03-29,5.0,Five represents excellent service & food! The old service station has great warm weather seating outside but it was still spring cool and we ate inside. The service was excellent and the food was great--great burgers with local beef and salad or fries. Even better steak plates ...our group had two burgers and two steak plates--outstanding local beef as good as it is going to get on this planet if one eats meat.,1.0,Black Cow
2023-08-04,4.0,"Good, but still not the best steak in town. 

Stopped in here for an early dinner. Both my fiancé and I ordered the Steak Frites from the Happy Hour Menu. I added the salad with the cherry vinaigrette to mine. The salad was really good! Not sweet, a nice flavor. They had also brought us bread and that was good as well. 

For drinks, my fiancé got the Walnut Old Fashioned. It was very sweet, which the waiter had warned us about, but we both agreed it would have made a better dessert drink than meal drink. I had a couple glasses of the Malbec which was really nice. 

The steak frites were good. The fries were excellent, and fries aren't usually something I notice, so well done! The steaks themselves were great, but not the best I've had in the Cville area (I think I'm still committed to South and Central). For the price, however, this place is amazing! Bearnaise sauce was thoroughly delicious.  

Our waiter was 10/10, and perhaps one of the best servers I've had in a long time, polite, charming, and knowledgeable. When there was a problem with my fiancés first drink (a lone bug had made a dive into it), he was able to comp it for 50% (totally fair because he had drunk half of it!!), and got my fiancé the classic old fashioned (which he ordered instead, and thought tasted better anyways). 

The ambiance was relaxed, a comfortable volume to have a private conversation, and cozy. The seating was comfortable as well. Cool to be able to see and smell the grill. I also LOVED the music (a nice mix of music from the 30s-60s). 

Overall, great vibes, great flavors and great values.",141.0,Black Cow

2023-04-17,4.0,Love this newly opened restaurant! I got the steak frites for the happy hour deal(highly recommend taking advantage of that) and holyy COW they were udder-ly delicious! The fries were crispy and seasoned well while the steak itself was terrifically tender. Our server was also really knowledgeable of the menu and the service was overall superb. Will definitely come back here to try more of the appetisers and the other cocktails!,38.0,Black Cow
2023-04-23,4.0,"Had a nice Sunday happy hour dinner here with friends. I ordered the Black Cow Steak Frites with the add-on Little Salad, and a glass of their happy hour featured red wine. The featured red wine was a Malbec. The chef's choice daily cut was a hanger steak with chimichurri sauce. I'm a simple guy--steak frites paired with a nice red and I'm happy. The salad was a nice fresh and tasty addition to the meal. One note that I have is that I preferred the hanger steak without the chimichurri sauce. I felt that the hanger steak was seasoned well already, and that the chimichurri muted some of the steak's already nicely developed flavors. The regular menu is pricy, but I enjoyed my happy hour experience here and thought it was a great deal. I guess you could say that happy hour at Black Cow was in fact happy.",372.0,Black Cow

2023-01-05,5.0,"5 stars. We have a group we call The Fifty Shades of Gravy Club. We go to a different restaurant the last Saturday of the month. This month we choose this place. When we called for a reservation for a party of 8, they couldn't get us seated together. However, we arrived at 4:30 and Daniel figured out where he could put two tables together as long as we promised to be done by 6:30. I said it would depend on if we got fast service, and boy did we! Our waiter was John. His second day on the job. He was a Wizard. We got happy hour drinks (can you imagine happy hour on a Saturday!) He described all the meats and told us which ones were flavorful but chewy, and which were tender. The sauces were extra. They were to die for. The meat entrees came with a salad that was lightly dressed with a homemade dressing of your choice. Most of the sides were family style and sooo good. I am doing a Keto diet so I was in heaven. The portions of the steak most of us order were huge. Two of the smart people among us shared theirs. I took my leftover home and had dinner again the next day. AND instead of handing me a box for my leftovers, John took my plate back to the kitchen and transferred my food into a styrofoam box that had parchment paper in it. Who does that anymore!?! It was great because I was able to transfer the food using the parchment paper instead of scraping it off the box. Everyone loved what they ordered. I will definitely return to this restaurant again. It is now my new favorite.",16.0,Black Cow
2023-07-05,5.0,"This place is so great!! I love wood-fired meats, generally, and they have chosen quality vendors for them. Drinks, apps, salads, mains, lobster mac and cheese (best I've ever had!!), and dessert was perfect for my husband's (chef) birthday. It's nice to see a menu that is streamlined, straightforward, and executed perfectly in a restaurant that knows itself and it's customers. 

Being a new location, you expect some hiccups, but they really have nailed it with every aspect. They fill that space well. We can't wait to go back.",49.0,Black Cow

2023-05-29,5.0,"We were passing through Charlottesville and were looking for a good place for dinner.  We found the Black Cow and were really glad we chose this restaurant to eat at.  The service was fantastic, but the food is what we will remember most!  The smoked oysters are to die for, the truffle fries are the best we have ever had ANYWHERE, the burger was fantastic and the beet salad was amazing. This restaurant is new and I truly hope the locals support them so that we can keep coming back whenever we are in Charlottesville!",4.0,Black Cow

You can spend a lot or spend a little (one great steak frites special), and the cocktail menu keeps you coming back for more.

2023-11-06,5.0,"We had a great dinner here for our anniversary! Once we were there, we learned the restaurant has only been open a few months. The steaks were cooked to perfection! Each entree comes with a side salad (which was large) of tender greens with thin sliced radish and cucumber. We had the Choice of their homemade ranch or vinaigrette, which were both tasty. We had the steak tartar for an appetizer and it was on point!! I had the filet mignon and my husband the Chateubriand  and they were both cooked to perfection. My filet was like butter. You have several choices of toppings for your steak, if you wish. My husband got the béarnaise sauce and it was very light and tasty. Each steak also comes with a yummy roasted pearl onion/garlic side. We share the creamed spinach for a side and it was delicious! The key lime pie is probably better then the key lime pie we had in the Keys! Tart and sweet but not too sweet. Our server was very nice and informative and knew the menu well and gave good recommendations- which we appreciate. We would definitely recommend this place and we will return when we visit Cville in the future.",13.0,Black Cow
2023-06-13,5.0,Superb!! Service was great. Everyone was very helpful navigating the menu. The food was fantastic with the exception of the Brussel sprouts which were almost burnt in my opinion.

2023-05-07,5.0,"This past weekend we ate at Black Cow Chophouse and I enjoyed one of the best meals I've ever had! 

We had their special mezcal cocktail to start then ordered the buttermilk fried oysters for an appetizer. I love fried oysters but these were were absolutely fantastic. 

All of the mains come with a fresh green salad with a choice of housemade dressings.  I got the fresh greens with vinaigrette dressing and while everyone makes a vinaigrette this one was exceptionally tasty.

We shared the bone in ribeye steak and an order of crab cakes for our main meal. 

The steak was delicious on its own but we added a few sauces including bearnaise sauce, peppercorn cream with cognac sauce and the horseradish sauce all of which were wonderful and pretty much pushed the steak over the top. 

The crab cakes had huge pieces of pure lump crabmeat combined with fresh seasonings, served with a light aioli so the flavor of the crabmeat really came through. 

We also ordered sides of smashed potatoes, fried brussel sprouts and fresh grilled zucchini. The potatoes were cooked so they were soft on the inside but had a slight crunch when you bit into them. They were topped with a light chimichurri sauce that made an amazing dish even better.  I'm not a brussel sprouts fan but the fried brussel sprouts were fantastic, light and slightly crisp so they would just melt in your mouth. I couldn't stop eating them! Then, I really wasn't expecting anything from the zucchini but again I was surprised by a dish that was lightly seasoned and cooked perfectly so it really provided a great balance to the meal. For dessert we shared the key lime pie and the chocolate mousse with sea salt and again, both dishes were fantastic - the key lime pie is now my favorite dessert of all time.

The staff were extremely attentive and delivered fantastic service. Our server did a great job covering the restaurants approach to food and service and helped guide us through the menu making excellent suggestions for wines, appetizers and our dinner selection.

The ambiance is fun and engaging vs. formal and stuffy which makes the whole experience at Black Cow Chophouse even more enjoyable.",3.0,Black Cow
2023-08-07,5.0,"My husband and I had an amazing anniversary dinner here this evening. From the spectacular service to the delicious food, so, so good. I wanted to try something different and had the bavette. SO. GLAD. I. DID. I had it with the chimichurri, but honestly, it didn't need it. I found myself going to the confit garlic on the side even more than the chimichurri, which was good by the way. That garlic though, I am going to need to learn how to make that at home. The smashed red potatoes were killer. We told our waiter we just wanted potatoes as a side, and for him to choose. Solid choice he made for us!",28.0,Black Cow
2023-07-13,5.0,"Tonight was a great night came in from Los Angeles to visit some family that have relocated.

Got a massive meal 5 apps, everyone got steaks,etc.

My steak was a bit undercooked while all the rest were perfect. I didn't even say anything but server could tell I wasn't pleased and rectified the situation very swiftly.

All in all we left full and the deserts were great.

Appreciate tier one level service and food on a Friday night in a small town!",51.0,Black Cow
2023-05-08,4.0,"Food was impeccable. We had a type of cut I had the Bavette, which I was excited to try and had never had before. Sides were also great. And while we sat outside and it was hot as you know what, it was manageable. The interior design is impressive and I'd return to eat inside. 

This place gets an additional star with an attitude adjustment. Pretentiuos hostess and pretentious, disinterested, gloomy server. 
I get it, everyone has a bad day. But put on your game-face for a few hours and smile at your customer.  We are an engaging fam...we are not pretentious and generally look for and bring positive mojo.  Perhaps it is just C-ville...but I doubt it.  #smile, please.",27.0,Black Cow

2023-07-09,5.0,"Really great place! Pretty interiors, busy bar, quick crowd. Friendly accommodating service. I ordered their drink special which was the pineapple fin- a really refreshing pineapple-infused finlandia vodka. Wish it was chilled a bit more but I really appreciated the big chunk of pineapple. I was worried it might be too sweet and ""juice"" tasting but I could really tell the cocktail was just infused (30 days, apparently!)

For food I started with the sherry vinaigrette salad. Simple mixed greens but the greens were super tender and fresh. Dressing was light, the added pickled onions and fine shredded parmesan were great. I got the bavette steak cooked medium, with side sauces of the peppercorn and the chimichurri. The steak had a great sear, came out more on the medium rare side and a tad salty, but the beef flavor was great. Also tried the creamed spinach and whipped potatoes which were so comforting and delicious, the potatoes were SO dangerously buttery and creamy. We also tried the belgian fries which were underwhelming- dry, felt a bit stale to me, no flavor. They are apparently featured as a specialty (double fried and all that) but reminded me of In-n-Out's anticlimactic fries. 

For dessert we tried the crême brûlée, which was SO decadent with a perfectly crisp glassy top. The key lime pie had a perfect balance of flavor, tartness, sweetness, and a creamy texture complemented well with the crunchy rich crust. I didn't get a chance to try the flourless cake and ice cream but they must have been food because they were gone in a pinch!

Overall great place, I would come back if I was in the area. Lots of options to fit any budget and generally enjoyable experience!",131.0,Black Cow

2023-10-13,4.0,"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and I would say the steak at Black Cow is solid. I thought the steak was seasoned well on its own. Glad to see that they aren't afraid to use salt! We also ordered some sides to share with the table and the lobster mac and cheese was definitely the showstopper. I liked how the mac and cheese had a slight crust on it. The only thing about our experience is that some of our steaks were inconsistent in terms of cook. Some steak frites that were ordered with red came out with no red.

Then to finish it off we got crème brûlée and **** me that was to die for. And let me say all that was inexpensive for the heaven that reached my stomach.

What a steal for a high quality tasty steak and delicious crispy fries. I got to try the flank with chimichurri sauce and it was perfectly cooked, tender, and flavorful. I have nothing bad to say about it! I also tried the fried brussels - one of my favorite sides/appetizers and they did not disappoint.

2024-01-20,2.0,"Maybe it was just a really off night for the food we were served when we visited the Black Cow Chophouse . They have an amazing sounding happy hour where you can order Steak Frites for $18. We decided to stop in after a long week of work and got there around 5:40 (happy hour of 4-6). The hostess told us we had 5 minutes to order so we hurried to the last two seats at the bar and ordered quickly.

I ordered a Moscow Mule and my boyfriend ordered a Margarita. Both were just not good. The Moscow mule had virtually no ginger beer in it.

The steak dinners were so disappointing. Everything was SO salty-I couldn't even eat the fries. The one steak was cooked incorrectly (asked for medium rare and it was medium well). Both steaks were warm at best, definitely not fresh. We understand steaks need to rest but these had rested wayyyy too long. 

The bartender never checked on us. The two stars are for the ambiance of the restaurant. For almost $70, definitely a disappointing visit.",227.0,Black Cow
2024-01-21,5.0,"The Black Cow Chophouse is one of the most amazing places I have ever dined. I have spent six months trying to come up with a way to accurately describe this restaurant in a review. The staff and service is phenomenal, personal, and full of expertise. The selection of local steak is not only artisan but also very well priced, the cocktails are handcrafted with a wonderful attention to detail. The Steak Tare Tare and the crushed potatoes are by far the best food I've ever had, over the several visits to the Black Cow the bar is raised every time by consistent performance. I have had the luxury of eating across several countries and I can say without a doubt the Black Cow Chophouse is one of the finest places I have ever been.

This is while someone was already preparing the table for our group. Clearly communication lacks between employees.

We were only in town for two days and didn't have dinner plans our second night, but we had walked past this place earlier in the day and decided to come back that night - so glad we did! It was pretty full, even at 8:45 when we got there, and the vibe was great - simple and modern aesthetic, laid back feel, friendly staff, good wine list - checked all the boxes!

We shared the bone-in KC strip and the whipped golden potatoes for dinner. The steak tasted great - we ordered in medium rare, and it almost looked closer to rare, but I'll take that over a steak being overcooked any day. I liked the confit onions & garlic and the generous pile of sea salt on the plate with the steak, too - really brought out the flavor! The whipped potatoes were a treat as well - they had some of the confit onions and garlic on them too, and they were a great compliment to the meat. 

Would definitely recommend Black Cow to anyone looking for a great steak in Charlottesville - it was lovely!",213.0,Black Cow

I added a bit more but even so, he saved me a considerable sum. Thank you, Landon, and we highly recommend Black Cow!",25.0,Black Cow

2024-04-16,3.0,"Pretty solid food and service. But they have not cooked my steak correct a single time I have gone. The first two times I asked for medium, the steak came out completely raw (they cut it before service, so they are aware of the steak's temperature). 

Last time I went, I was asked if I wanted my steak ""pink or no pink"" which is very strange and probably not what you should be asking for a steak. The steak came out cold and raw on the inside. Given the language on the menu, the kitchen seems to have strong opinions on how a steak needs to be cooked (raw/rare). To sum up, if you want solid food and are cool with your steak being very undercooked, I think you will enjoy this place a lot.",18.0,Black Cow

2024-04-05,5.0,"Drove into Charlottesville, VA from Baltimore, and went to the Yelp app to look for a dinner venue.  The Black Cow looked interesting, and we were ready for red meat.

The venue is cool.  It appears to be an old service station that has been  decorated in a bovid motief.  It has a nice bar, not very large, seats about 10.  Outside dining is available

We did not have reservations, and the wait was about an hour, so we chose to eat at the bar.  Good choice!  The bartender (Noah) was excellent.  The bourbon selection was also excellent.  I had my first pour of Woodford 121.2.  Really enjoyed it.

The salads were good.  Warm bread was served.  We both had the New York strip, and they were nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked.

Everything we ordered (except for the complimentary bread and butter) needed salt at the least. Crab cakes were bland and oddly sweet. Lobster mac and cheese sauce was a little grainy, maybe too much flour used. It also had little to no seasoning. Was disappointed given the cost.

The bartenders (especially the female one) were so warm, professional, and accommodating. I had the best cosmopolitan drink of my life. We decided to order one additional steak a few minutes before the happy hour promotion expired, and the bartender quietly told the kitchen to rush the order so that it would come out with the rest of our food, just a couple of minutes later. The happy hour steak frites special is a must-order, and an incredible value. Highly recommend if you're in Charlottesville and staying near the downtown area. One thing to note: downtown Charlottesville does have a significant homeless and panhandling population. We were approached at our car in the adjacent parking lot.

Have ever had as a server: our water
Was never empty, our drinks were fast and her
Knowledge of the menu and taste was impeccable.  Happy hour was amazing! We had the $8.00 Kentucky mule and margaritas. Strong! 
Our Dinner was the steak frites and was the best steak I have ever had in my entire life! ( the cut was something that began with a T). The sauce that came with it was a house made A-1 sauce that was really good and blue cheese crumbles.Fries were good, but nothing over the top. Our side was the summer squash! What the hell...! To make that vegetable stand out like it did, I was speechless.  Roasted and placed in a cashew pesto!! We were fighting with forks for the last bite!
One more drink each. Oh our hostess came over and wished us a happy anniversary, and made my wife tear up when she read to my wife what I wrote about her. Very nice young lady and I am so sorry that I forgot her name. 
 The dessert....holy moly....!
The chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce was a knockout! I would bar fight the whole
Place for more. The crème Brule, was also outstanding an came in a close
Second for dessert.
I must say we have missed out on this little

2024-07-13,5.0,"Add us to the Black Cow fan club!  We split our time between Cville and Austin now, and it seems each time we return another steakhouse has closed.  It was great to see a new steakhouse--and a good one!-- has finally opened.  A friend invited us for a very early dinner so we could try the ""early bird"" Steak and Frites meal.  At $18, it seemed too good to be true.  It isn't!  It appears they vary the steak cut and the sauce each week.  This time it was 6 oz sirloin with meunière sauce and fries.  For $3 you can add a dinner salad, which I did.  The steak was prepared perfectly: rare for me and well done for my wife (they say there are only two choices, pink and well, but I asked for the rarest they would cook my steak and was very happy).  We both passed on the sauce, which the flavorful, juicy steak didn't need.  My salad was just fine.  The highlight of the meal--good as the steak was--is the fries.  A nice portion of perfectly fried, hot, relatively thin French fries.

Our waiter was friendly, patient, and helpful.  The entire experience was excellent and we will return, and not just for the special.  The regular steak menu looked wonderful.  While not cheap, for a high-end steakhouse prices seemed quite reasonable.",36.0,Black Cow

The food was really good though. We shared a hangar steak and a filet. Both were cooked to medium rare. I thought the hangar steak had a really good flavor. You could actually taste the marinade. My husband loved the bernaise sauce with the filet. For sides we had spinach and the Belgian fries. The spinach is definitely pretty spinachy if that makes sense. Not your typical creamed spinach. It was good. The fries were very small and crispy and not like anything we had in Belgian. The flavor was good but I would skip them next time.

We were well taken care of by the hostess and bartender who got us to the bar around 7:30 after we opened a bottle of wine on their outdoor lounge. 

The bar was cozy and the servers were attentive and warm, but the food was exactly what I needed that day! They cook their burgers ""no pink"" or ""pink"" and I assume ""no pink"" is closer to medium and ""pink"" is medium rare to rare. We ordered a bacon bleu burger ""pink"" and were really happy with it. Typically I like my burgers medium so I might try taking my chances with the no pink next time since I can't see them cooking it over with their ""no well done"" policy for the cuts of meat. 

The fries, Brussels sprouts, and Mac and cheese were delicious, especially with the garlic aioli. I think after the burger, the Mac and cheese was a favorite. I don't usually go for lobster Mac and cheese, but this one was exceptional. You could actually taste the lobster stock throughout the sauce as well as the cheese.",72.0,Black Cow

2024-10-14,3.0,"This was the first time we ever ate at Black Cow Chophouse. We frequent steakhouses often and looked forward to trying a new one. Made reservations in advance and was seated promptly. 

We placed our orders (party of four) and two of use do not eat salads. After some time passed we were given 2 salads and one portion of bread for 4 people. Almost one hour passed and we still didn't have our entrees. I asked for another bread and she said it would cost $3. I said it was ok and she came back and told us they will not be doing double breads. 

About 15 mins later the meals came out and my medium well steak was clearly undercooked. It was pink and a little bloody. The waitress told me that it was medium well in front of my party. I disagreed and she then agreed to recook it. Another person in my party ordered a medium steak and it was also bloody. She didn't want to say anything after seeing the reaction I got. They brought my steak back to me and half of it was cooked and the other half looked the same. She walked away before I could say anything. I actually picked up the plate, located her and told her I give up. The manager came over and told me she wanted to talk about the steak. Again, this felt weird in front of my party and I'm on the spot. I said half of it was improved but it's too bloody on the other. I just wanted to move on. 

Overall, my party was happy with the food. A little disappointed the reaction and combativeness about the steak temperature. So I didn't get a steak and still wasn't offered some bread while everyone else ate their meals",87.0,Black Cow

2024-12-16,5.0,"John our waiter took such lovely care of us. He was right. This steak (I got the boneless ribeye) was one of the top 10 steaks I've ever had in my life. You can tell the meat here is very high quality. The steak came out with a lovely sear. The flavor was rich and meaty; my steak was very well marbled and fatty. I loved that the steaks were served with flaked finishing salt that you could sprinkle on, yourself. I believe the biggest factor was that David cooked our steaks to PERFECTION. My husband got the NY Strip and he was over the moon. I tried a bite and it was just fantastic. I'm not even a NY strip eater! You can easily mess up a Strip. And yet it was juicy and tender.

I personally don't think the steak needed a sauce.

As for the appetizers and sides, the bread was excellent and fresh. The cesar salad was very very tasty. The shrimp cocktail was great! But the real show were those steaks. John, our waiter, encouraged us as first time guests to get steak (over the pork chop I was considering), and I'm so thrilled he did. A warm and genuinely friendly waiter, John made the night. I trusted his suggestions, and very happy I did. You can tell John loves his job, and he's good at it.

The prices were fair given the quality of the ingredients.

The ambiance of the restaurant was somewhat loud but that never hindered our conversations or evening.

The final suprise of the night was the desserts. The key lime pie was literally the best key lime pie I've ever had. Was such a perfect touch to a wonderful evening.

Kudos to this team. A giant thank you to John for taking such great care of us, and the highest compliments to David and the chefs who prepared the meals.

While the drinks were food and drinks were excellent, we were hustled multiple times during the meal, before we even ordered; we were told several times that our table needed to be done by a specific time (2 hours). we were told at least 3 times that we needed to be faster, when we finished our main and inquired about desert we were told that the next table was here and that we could only have dessert to go. when the check arrived we set it for pay immediately, but they took 10 min to collect it, which felt strange considering that they had been adamant that they needed the table.
not sure if this is their policy or they poorly planed their reservations
Great food does not make up for poor treatment by staff, and 2 hours at a steak house is not a long time for a group of 4.

They have a fabulous happy hour special and one of enjoyed that (cut of the day, sauce of the day, and fries).  I enjoyed the hanger since I like a medium rare steak and the special only comes pink or no pink.  We ordered fries - super crispy!  Double fried I was informed.  Should've gone with the Brussels sprouts instead of the creamed spinach it was watery and under seasoned.  I would definitely go again.

There is a good variety of indoor and outdoor seating depending on your mood and plenty of outlets inside to plug in your laptop. The drinks can be a little pricey as expected for a small coffee shop, but the food options are more reasonably priced (both breakfast and lunch available). I had an oat milk latte to start off and then the Kale Caesar as a late lunch which was super tasty (heavily dressed and tossed with lots of shredded parmesan plus in-house made croutons). My husband got ""The Mother"" sandwich which was huuuge and brought his leftovers home. We also shared the Maitake Poppers which were delicious and had a texture similar to tempura/lightly fried calamari.

For brunch we took the boys. The cinnamon rolls had been calling my name since Friday so we got one to share (they're big and did not wait for a picture). I then had the avocado toast with sunny egg and it was on point. They use their homemade bread for the toast and it's so so good with a thick crunchy crust. He had the avocado, chili paste and egg sandwich on brioche and it looked amazing. The kids shared a #2 - bacon egg and cheese on an English muffin, which was homemade and extra delicious.

I also got the #1 breakfast sandwich which was huge., but was almost too big because of the amount of egg and not one item on it had much flavor.

The omelette might have been the best I've ever had.  It was light and fluffy and perfectly seasoned.  The side salad was just romaine hearts with light dressing which, as it sounds, was unimpressive.  My boyfriend said his Benedict was very good although the eggs were over easy instead of poached.  The portion of lox was very generous and he finished every bite.  The coffee donut was average.  Not really a lot of coffee flavor but still yummy.

The English muffins were fresh baked, soft, and delicious. The bacon and egg were cooked well, and the cheddar was nice and melted how I like it. 

The Belle Benedict with Lox was great. The bread was freshly baked and paired nicely with the runny egg to soak up the yolk. And the microgreen salad complimented the dish well to give it more freshness. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Belle. The restaurant was cute and lively during my Sunday brunch visit. And the freshly baked bread in the breakfast orders was amazing.

I though the prices were a little on the steep side, but the food was so good that I couldn't give Belle any less than five stars. The homemade bread, especially the english muffins, brought my breakfast to the next level. I got breakfast sandwich #6. The combination of the sweetness of the jam (I believe it was apricot?) and the saltiness of the prosciutto created an amazing flavor profile. I added an egg, but I would recommend to just get the sandwich as is. The egg made it a little too messy and didn't add much flavor-wise. However, all the original components of the sandwich were delicious, and to top it all off it was served on a homemade english muffin! I also tried the avocado toast. Although the flavors were great, it was difficult to eat because the bread was so thick (and a little tough).

2021-11-30,5.0,"As an unabashed lover of carbs and a gluten enthusiast, Belle's menu based on naturally leavened breads enthused me. My wife and I finally checked out this place during a recent Friday lunch, and our meal left us thoroughly impressed. 

We opted for Belle's take on an Italian hoagie for me and a eggplant-tahini sandwich for her. As a Philadelphian, I take my hoagies very seriously and have had many a disappointing sub during my time in the South. Belle's rendition tasted so good I nearly wept. The bread makes the sandwich, and Belle's hoagie roll could go toe-to-toe with the best rendition I've had in Philly and elsewhere. The quality Italian cold cuts, zippy pepper relish, and crisp lettuce and tomato made for a bite that reminded me of home and satisfied immensely. 

While I'm partial to the hoagie for sentimental reasons, my wife's eggplant sandwich tasted equally good. Hers arrived on crispy yet fluffy focaccia paired smartly with meaty eggplant, chopped eggs, and creamy potato chunks tossed in a deliciously verdant tahini sauce. The sandwich was incredibly messy but offered a punch of flavor on, of course, awesome bread. We ended with a sweet treat in Belle's sourdough cinnamon roll. The roll itself was not too sweet and the sour kick from the ferment played well with the sugary glaze. The base bread was moist and chewy, and thus represented a big improvement from most of the cinnamon rolls we tried prior.

The carb feast sat well in our stomachs, a testament to the slow, natural fermentation this place specializes in. My wife and I left this place full and yet eager to return and explore more of the menu. If you're in the mood for sandwiches or quality bread/baked goods, Belle should be your next stop.",480.0,Belle

When the sandwich that I ordered came out, it was cold and the avocado it had on it tasted rotten (you know that unfortunate taste avocado has when it's just not right...). It also just had what tasted like a cold Sriracha chili sauce squirted all over it. 

I went up to the lady working the register and showed her my sandwich and explained that the avocado tasted rotten and would it be possible to get something different? She got a man from the kitchen who I assume was the manager and I repeated the predicament to him to which he just stared at me and replied blankly ""Well that's too bad,"" with no sense of sympathy, apology, or customer service.

If you want to have a nasty message written about you to describe what table to deliver your food, this place is for you. Despite the very nice aesthetic, good food, and outdoor seating, the front staff is incredibly unprofessional and rude. Despite their demeanor, our group chocked it up to being very busy, which was understandable. We placed our order and found a table outdoors. However, when our food was delivered to our table, our receipt described one person in our group as ""the little bitc* in the red crop top and purple shorts"" as the person to deliver the food to. Amazingly, the server set this receipt down directly in front of us in full view. We were shocked, as there was not any sort of confrontation or atypical interaction with the woman taking our order. Upon talking about this with the employee who wrote the message, she simply said ""okay"" and walked away. For a business with a photo of ""Rosie the Riveter"" on the wall, they surely do not know how to respect other women.

The omelet was like nothing I've ever seen before. I would definitely recommend going on a day where you can sit in the outdoor seating and soak in the sun with your meal. My only complaint is that the food took long with only one person in the kitchen on a Wednesday and they weren't able to heat up the focaccia bread I'd ordered in the restaurant. I love that the place is dog friendly though!!!,246.0,Belle

2023-05-22,5.0,"It's hard to find a good French toast!! Quite often they are beautifully grilled on the outside, only to cut into what turns out to be just dry or flavorless bread.

If you are craving really yummy French toast, made the way it's supposed to be made, moist and flavorful, this is the place to go on Sundays for brunch!!! No really!! The scrabbled eggs, bacon and side salad were equally delicious.

Belle puts love into making food, especially their sourdough breads!

Stopping here on my way for a quick breakfast with my group, the service was not only fast, but very accommodating for a carry out order. Rarely do I get paralyzed by choice, but what caught my eye was the smoked whitefish sandwich on brioche and I am SO glad I went with this piece of art. The whitefish was salty and tangy slathered all over the buttery and perfectly toasted brioche. Companions of mine got some donuts and bread as well and WOW - I seriously couldn't get over the donuts and the bread we shared was soft, chewy and didn't even need butter. The cold brew paired so perfectly with our whole meal, and couldn't resist an extra picture out front.",618.0,Belle

They were quite busy when we arrived, but they were constantly restocking their case of pastries. There was a little bit of a wait on the coffee but the food was relatively quick considering how busy it was. They have indoor and outdoor seating and a nice variety on the menu. I had potentially, the best breakfast sammie of my life, while at Belle. The picture I took, does it absolutely no justice, but I did include it in the review. I ordered the #1 with cheddar and my sister ordered the #6 (at least I think that is what she ordered). My breakfast sammie was filled with generous helpings of sausage and egg. The cheese wasn't overdone and the bread made it feel like I was almost eating a burger. It was a 10/10 experience.

Another note to keep in mind is that they do not serve their sandwiches on Sundays. Patrons seat themselves and order near the front of the restaurant. There was no music playing (that I could tell), but it was difficult to hear my partner because of the noise generated by the surrounding patrons. I ordered the Belle mushroom and Gruyere omelette. The food was served in under 10 minutes after our order. This omelette was one of the best I have ever tried. The egg was perfectly cooked, and the balance of flavors was excellent.

Speaking of the sandwich, it was slopped up with multiple sauces and dripped all over the place. I didn't finish the second half because it was so sloppy and squishy.

2024-02-18,3.0,"A frustrating night and not sure we'd go back. We had a reservation for 6:45pm.  We arrive and are told our table isn't ready because the party ahead of us are lingering. . No problem. The hostess/waitress comes around to take our drink order and we hang out.  30 minutes later we are seated but still haven't received our drinks.  And we're seated at a table for 8 even though our reservation is for 10 people.  Two people in our group are late so we've ordered appetizers and they order drinks and appetizers.  All our appetizers come and our drinks finally arrive 45 min after we got there  minus our friends who are late drinks.  

We put in our dinner orders and another round of drinks.  Our friends still haven't received their first drinks.  

Our dinners come and our friends still don't have their drinks.  The bartender has no clue. An hour after our friends ordered their drinks they finally get their drinks AFTER THEY ASKED where they were.   It was clear their drink order hadn't been put in or the bartender didn't see it.  

I really enjoyed our Brussel sprouts appetizer and sourdough bread appetizer.  We got the steak frites and it was fine. Nothing to write home about.  Half our party got the butternut squash risotto and there was zero butternut squash in it and the truffle was overwhelming.  Our entire table smelled like truffle oil.  

It took forever to get drink orders. Even though it's a small restaurant it was clear that the bartender could not keep up with the service. They probably need a second bartender. 

All in all it was meh.  Honestly I don't think we'd go back.

2024-12-03,5.0,"Okay, I want to start by saying we drove an hour off route on an 11 hour trip just to eat this sandwich again.

I'm from PA, where pizza shops are abundant and subs with fresh baked bread are top notch. Italian subs are one of my absolute favorite delights.

Now, when I say the Italian sandwich at Belle is stellar, I cannot under emphasize the authenticity of this classic. It's an iconic replication of the standard with class, tact and intention. The sourdough roll/mini baguette is out of this world soft with a nice toasty crust. 

It seems like the meat is sourced ethically, but maybe I'm making that up for the sake of my own pretentious nature. Then, the hunk of real mozzarella is a delicious touch of mouth watering fat. Top it with the thin sliced reds and a balanced mix of Mayo / oil / vin and pepper relish?! AYFKM?! 

Pair it with a Mexican Coke and you have an ""elevated staple"". There I go with the pretentiousness again 

I want to also acknowledge the incredible staff who made accommodations for us driving a long distance and running really close to closing time. 

Make sure you get the English muffins, doughnuts, cinnamon rolls... whatever is in the sourdough bakery case, for your mornings after.

For $15, I was rather disappointed: the sandwich was fine but the cheese wasn't melted and prosciutto cotto was almost over powering. 

$15 for one sandwich with nothing on the side is a bit crazy in my opinion, unless it's an amazing sandwich. Plentiful indoor and outdoor seating, friendly staff. Be prepared to wait a little bit for food, I think I ended up waiting about 20 minutes for my sandwich. And parking lot/street parking is park mobile- not sure how often it's enforced.",227.0,Belle

2014-05-12,4.0,"My review is strictly for drinks....

Came last night just for drinks because a friend and I just had dinner. Bang! Has such an extensive cocktail/mixed drink selection. I saw prickly pear mojito and decide why not.this of course was after careful debate and endless consulting with our bartender. She told me it was sweeter then a typical mojito...well I've had horrible mojitos if it's sweeter maybe it won't taste crappy like the other ones I've had else where. Yay! Our bartender was the bomb...she made a mojito that didn't over muddle my mint and it tasted awesome love the prickly pear :o)  my friend got her usual the sin city and I stole a sip it was a sweet martini almost juice like not bad though pretty smooth. 

Of course I wanted dessert..... so why not have a dessert martini. So I got the dreamsicle....the menu said it would take me back to my childhood. Hmmm...very vanilla...where's the orange?? They did use real orange juice so perhaps that's why the flavor was there but was overshadowed by vanilla. My friend likes it and she dislikes dreamsicles a something about artificial orange that bothers her. But since this was more vanilla she didn't mind it too much. 


Overall Bang! Is great for mixed drinks and martinis.Pricey but hey your getting a good quality drink.",482.0,Bang
2017-12-05,3.0,"In short: we left $50 poorer, a little tipsy, but still hungry.  While Bang has a lot of fun and unique flavors (and a great drink menu!) its portions are tiny and overpriced.

I came with two friends on a Thursday evening at 6:30PM.  To our surprised, we were seated immediately, but Bang is known for having long waits during peak times.  When we left around 7:30PM, there were definitely many parties that were waiting.

As tapas goes, we got 7 things to share and two drinks each.  I'll rank below the dishes we got from my favorite to lease favorite.  

Kale tortellini (4) - A ricotta, cheese, and kale mixture wrapped in a wonton wrapper. Very tasty, but didn't care much for the wonton wrapper -- tasted kind of slimy

Pork spring rolls (6) - spring rolls wrapped in a rice paper I think? and fried so the outside was crispy and bubbly.  I thought this was very unique and haven't seen anything like it before! Perfectly seasoned, which is rare for spring rolls sometimes.  Didn't care much for the sauce it came with.  

Chicken cilantro wraps - These were pretty savory and a good balance of salty and slightly sweet, with a lot of sweet onions and peppers. I think it was all white meat, but would've probably been more flavorful with dark meat.  A full wedge of iceberg lettuce came on the side, which was very fresh and crisp.  I actually liked it more than the butter lettuce that I've usually had lettuce wraps with/

Coconut rice - Slightly sticky, sweet, and creamy, and good to pair with the other dishes.  However, we got a double portion and it was SO tiny! Like smaller than a side of rice you would get from a Chinese restaurant...yet this portion was $6...

60 second steak (6) - Very meaty and smoky, but not for everyone if you don't like your meat raw/very rare. The mushrooms it came with were meaty and flavorful too and helped amp up the small portion.  The cilantro sauce it came with too was refreshing and herbacious, but very, very light and hard to taste unless you drenched the meat in the sauce.  Two very disappointing things about this dish though: the plate was cold and I would've preferred this dish served room temp or warm.  Also the portion was TINY.  We each got literally two bites fo steak and it was $11.

Brie nachos (4) - The brie had a surprisingly meaty flavor which I enjoyed, but kind of a predictable dish overall.  Unfortunately, like the steak, this dish came out cold-- by that point the previously melted brie had solidified and was not melty anymore.  I would have preferred this dish if it came out warm so that the brie was still melty.

Goat cheese dumplings (4) - I was most excited for this one and most disappointed :( These were basically like pierogis except the filling was strangely sour (not like in a tangy goat cheese kind of way).  Portion was big though.

Drinks - Everyone was most pleased with their drinks.  We tried Sin City, Lemon Drop, Lychee, Diva, Prickly Pear -- all were good options.

Service was very friendly (although kind of annoyed that our waitress kept on pushing and pushing us to buy drinks) and pretty fast too.  Overall food was fine, but I probably won't return because the portions were so small and execution was very mediocre.",219.0,Bang

We also tried many different drinks. I had the key lime martini, caramel apple and the espresso martini and wow wow wow. All so amazing! My date had the Mr.Big, Sin City, and Captain and enjoyed them all as well.

2018-01-26,5.0,"Finally, a great vegetarian tapas restaurant! I came here for my birthday   and was wowwed by the uniqueness and quality of food. I ordered 6 dishes and recommend the sweet potato gnocchi, goat cheese dumplings, shredded brussel sprouts salad, and cauliflower dumplings. I wasn't a big fan of the kale ravioli or the chickpea spring rolls. 

My favorite was hands down the sweet potato gnocchi (I'm craving it just thinking about it!) I'm not a fan of gnocchi as it's often hard or too mushy, but the gnocchi was the best I've ever had. The gnocchi was so soft that it literally melted in my mouth. I love the savory sweet potato curry sauce. 

I really enjoyed the goat cheese dumplings, they are bursting with flavor and a generous portion size. 

I devoured the shredded brussel sprouts salad. Seems like a simplex dish, but has complex flavors. 

The cauliflower dumplings were perfectly fried with a nice crispy coating. I  like how they weren't doused in sauce. 

I didn't quite care for the kale ravioli. Sounds like an interesting cool concept, but very bland. The ravioli was stuffed with a kale paste, I couldn't taste any cheese or any other flavors. 

The chickpea spring rolls was another miss. It had a nice curry filling, but I didn't understand why the chick peas were served a side instead of in the roll. I'm not a fan of fried chickpeas, I like them in their natural state. 

The tapas portion sizes are quite large and filling, about 2-3 plates per person. Since I ordered 6, I brought home leftovers. As there are several options for vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free, and meat lovers, Bang! is a crowd pleaser. 

Overall, I had a hearty meal that put me in a delightful food coma. It's definitely worth the trip from DC.",1315.0,Bang
2018-07-19,5.0,"What an experience! I am BLOWN AWAY by the food at this restaurant! I came for restaurant week and shared a total of 9 tapas with my friends. Every single dish was delicious and filled with rich, mouthwatering flavors! I did not think I would enjoy this restaurant this much but it is honestly so good. Our favorites were the pork steam buns, haricot vert fries (green bean fries), the goat cheese dumplings, and Korean beef empanada.

BUT the best and most life changing item was their PISTACHIO BLONDIE with coffee ice cream! It was so good that we had to order another one. The texture was so soft and smooth and the tastes all blended perfectly. Bang makes the ice cream and caramel sauce themselves and you can tell how much quality they put into this dessert.

If you like goat cheese, the goat cheese dumplings are a must and the firecracker shrimp are always a crowd pleaser. I'd recommend around 2 tapas per person. However, the best thing on the menu in my opinion is the Sin City cocktail - it's a blackberry martini with just the right amount of tang and sweetness and no alcohol taste.",303.0,Bang
2018-10-11,5.0,"This place exceeded my expectations and I'm so happy with my dining experience. I always have reservations about tapas restaurants because the plates are not filling but this place got rid of all those reservations. The only con is the price- you have to go all out or not go at all. Plan to spend at least $100 with tax and tip for two people. If you don't ball out, you probably will not have a great experience.

Here are some of the items we tried:
-Sin City Martini: This blackberry and pomegranate mix is awesome. You can't really taste the alcohol but the drink is strong. It's tangy yet sweet. Definitely recommend this martini!
-Goat Cheese Dumplings: Calling all cheese lovers. These dumplings will blow you away. They're so incredibly cheesy and crispy.
-Sweet Potato Gnocchi: Gnocchi on a whole new level. The texture is chewy yet tender. The sweetness of the sweet potatoes adds a nice flavor element.
-Crab Pot Stickers: The ginger cream ties together this dish so well. The crab was soft and savory while the wrapper was delightfully crunchy. The shiitake mushrooms topping was amazing.
-House Smoked Salmon: I don't usually like smoked salmon but it's done so well here. The salmon had a smokey flavor that's indescribable.
-Sixty Second 7 Hills Sirloin: MY FAVE. The steak was so tender and well seasoned. It was slightly charred and topped with chimichurri sauce. The fingerling potatoes were the perfect side.
-Firecracker shrimp: This dish was good, although, very basic. It's just fried tempura shrimp with a spicy mayo sauce on top. Definitely something I could make at home. In my opinion, it shouldn't be one of the most expensive item on the menu.
-Pork Belly Bun: Fatty pork belly on steamed bun? Yes, please.
-Lamb Ravioli: The ravioli was really good- filled with a lot of lamb. The sauce was insanely delicious. It had a curry flavor which gave it a nice kick.

Overall, this place is worth checking out. If you're on a budget, avoid this place because the experience will not be there. We definitely had a bang! of a time.",222.0,Bang
2019-01-23,4.0,"Decided to come here for restaurant week and was not disappointed! The key lime pie martini was amazing; the graham cracker crumbs on the rim provided the perfect touch. Tapas were delicious- 3 tapas will make you very full. The goat cheese dumplings are the best- creamy on the inside but with chewy, crispy wraps. The tuna wasabi flatbread was pretty good, too. The dressing had the perfect amount of wasabi in it, but the pita flatbread could be warmer. The duck potstickers were fantastic- highly recommend that and the goat cheese dumplings. For dessert, we got the pistachio blonde with caramel ice cream. The first few bites were heavenly but it was too rich for me to be able to enjoy the entire dish.

2019-10-03,4.0,"I really enjoyed our experience here. I would recommend going here with a big group so that you can share everything. The dishes come out as they are made so it may be a little uncomfortable if you aren't sharing. Our group ordered upwords of 12 dishes so we had a great spread.

The Great:
Brussel Sprouts- I could have eaten the whole thing by myself. The sauce coated the whole sprout and we liked the combination of sauces.
Mahi- my personal favorite. Cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. It is a small portion so if you are wanting more than a bite I wouldn't split it between more than 2 people.
Kale Ceasar- nice texture and flavor
BBQ Tacos- mmm. Very tasty and the meat had a nice BBQ sauce
Goat Cheese Dumplings- filled up with a good amount of cheese and they mixed spice in there that made the cheese pop

The Good:
Beef Empanadas- good amount of filling inside it
Firecracker Shrimp- I don't like shrimp so I can't comment but the group liked it. Spicy!!
Chicken Shwarma- cooked really well

The Wouldn't Order Again:
Duck Pot Stickers- were okay, couldn't taste much flavor, only thing that wasn't cooked that well. A few were burned.
Chickpea Spring Rolls- everyone in our group said this was our least favorite dish. We didn't really get any flavor. It was basically mashed up chickpeas without seasoning fried
Drunken Noodles- I would just rather go get some at a Thai place that specializes in that. Others liked it.

The martinis are delicious. I always love a good key lime pie martini. It was pie in a glass! Overall, I love going here with friends and a variety of food.",396.0,Bang

My favorites were the pan seared mahi and the firecracker shrimp. the mahi was cooked to perfection--very moist and flavorful. The shrimp was just a great combo of various sauces. My friends were not a big fan of the Mongolian beef noodles, but I enjoyed them! 

They have some outdoor seating, but I highly recommend making a reservation because they were all reserved when we got there around 6, with an hour or so wait for availability.

The atmosphere inside is nothing to rave about, but outside seating looked like a good vibe.

I always go back to the drunken noodles and kale ceasar, but you honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I've never had less than stellar service.

-Lamb dumplings
-Viet pork shoulder
-Drunken eggplant noodles
-Tuna/mango poke bowl

All of it was solid. Definitely got that asian fusion vibe. Honestly my favorite was the king oyster mushroom steamed bun. The bun itself is soft and has got a nice texture that goes well with any of the fillings. But the oyster mushroom was absolutely delicious (if you like mushrooms) and was paired perfectly with their miso mayo sauce.

Came on a Wednesday and was so pleasantly surprised to find out that it was Specials Night!  $6 Tapas and $7 Martinis - what a steal!  We ordered a nice variety - the korean empanadas, the shrimp shumai, the beef noodles, the kale cesar, and the Thai meatballs.  My favorites were definitely the beef noodles and the kale cesar salad, with the meatballs coming in close.  Flavors were fun and interesting!  My one piece of beef (pun slightly intended) with the dishes is that they were a little on the oily/saucy side.  This might just be me, but even though I loved the noodles, I felt like they were dripping with oil.  The salad was bomb, but had a little too much dressing on it for my taste.  The shumai - which are not reaaallly shumai - were slippery and hard to hold their shape.

Please, do not get me wrong - I will most likely be coming back to Bang!  the flavors were on point and unique!  Nonetheless this was my takeaway from my experience.  Also, the service was absolutely incredible!  Our server was attentive and very kind, and continuously making sure that we were well taken care of.

They have amazing drinks, probably the best Martinis in town.
There really isn't an option to order a full meal, the whole concept is that you get multiple small plates that you share with others. So if you're not a share you may not want to go with other people.
All of the small plates are quite delicious and paired well with complementary flavors. I've been here at least twice, and I've not been disappointed by any of the plates or drinks I've gotten.

The best items were definitely the goat cheese dumpling and the beef empanada. They were both delicious, though not entirely fresh. 

The buns were a little more disappointing. They were small, even for bao. The real problem was that the chicken was clearly not fresh. It was chewy and tough like it had sat out for a while, and was room temp. The beef was better tasting but also not warm. 

The drink was very strong and had good flavor. It looked smaller in the cup it comes in, but was just right for two cups.

Would order again: genera tso's cauliflower, fried brussels, Kale Caesar

Enjoyed but didn't love: goat cheese dumplings, fried chicken buns, pork belly buns, edamame

Would pass: drunken noodles

The vegetarian items were the star of the show. As with most other tapas, I found Bang to be slightly overpriced for what you get.

Upon entering the area we were greeted with a sign at the front which explained dining instructions, takeout instructions, as well as opening hours! (Pictured)

We of course opted to sit outside on their front porch to look at all the beautiful plants and spring scenery! We were seated, and greeted by a sweet server who told us about the menu and how to work it!

I came into this knowing we would order several small plates to share so here we go!

Caesar Kale Salad- this was very crunchy, fresh, and cool on a warmer day! It was beautifully plated and seasoned nicely. It was a little on the sweeter side for my liking but I enjoyed it anyways! (Love a good starter salad)

Drunken Noodles- These also had a wonderful flavor and were mixed with yummy veggies and mushrooms and a hint of spice amidst the sweet sauce!

House Pickles- I love pickles! Almost everywhere I go if it's on the menu, I'll try them! These are the sweeter type, not dill, tad bit of a spice, and very crunchy and delicious!

Chicken Buns- These are the BEST!!! The buns were so soft and doughy and the chicken was deliciously moist with a wonderful spicy Mayo! I could have eaten about three of those in addition to the other things we ordered! What can I say? I love chicken and this his all the spots for me!!!

Braised Short-Rib Dumplings- These were to die for and they certainly didn't hold back on the meat for all you meat lovers! They were literally packed with the tenderest rib meat with just the right spices! The miso mayo was a favorite and complimented the dish very well!

Crab Pot Stickers- Came out beautiful as did the rest! The post sticker had a nice crispy shell that wasn't greasy at all. The filling was a nice blended filling with a delicates crab and seafood taste (according to my husband, I'm not the seafood lover). They looked awesome and as was everything, BEAUTIFUL!

Water was brought out complimentary and we ordered two sprites which were served in cans with glasses of ice. I noticed they had many drinks, sake, beer, so I wanted to try out something non-alcoholic (daiquiri, special soda, mock tail) because I no longer drink, but unfortunately the basic sodas and water were my options.

*Korean Beef Empanada: Pretty good. the Meat wasn't evenly distributed but still flavorful

*General Tsos Cauliflower: I don't know why but I wasn't expecting breaded and fried, but it was and the flavor profile was spot on

*Crab pot stickers: Probably my least favorite. The crab flavor is just over powering so it was a little one note

We ordered the Brussels, Ginger Pear & Avocado Salad, Pork Belly Steamed Buns, and Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs. The Brussels were delicious but I felt like the other dishes were average.

The Flash Fried Brussels tasted amazing. They were perfectly fried, and the sauce and seasoning on the Brussel sprouts were tasty. I would definitely order this dish again.

The Ginger Pear & Avocado Salad had a great flavor profile. The sweet pear, salad greens, and dressing were really nice; however, the dish would have been perfect if the avocado were fresher (dark spots can be seen in the picture). For a restaurant like Bang!, I would expect the ingredients to be fresher and held to a higher standard. Especially the vegetables considering it leans more vegetarian in its options.

The Pork Belly Steamed Buns were good but not amazing. We enjoyed the dish; however, coming from DC, I've tasted better and more delectable pork belly buns.

The Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs were average. There are definitely better ribs in Charlottesville for much less. That's not to say that the ribs tasted bad because they tasted good, but for the price they did not meet my expectations.

2021-10-07,4.0,"I had come here once before and came back with my boyfriend because of my raving review the first time. Unfortunately, the food didn't measure up this time around, although the goat cheese dumplings were truly a delight (and likely the most popular item). 

Before ordering, we were told that the tapas (as the name suggests) are fairly small, except for the drunken noodles and the tuna poke bowl, so we should order 2-3 per person. We opted to order 6 in total (ended up being 5 because one of the items ordered was forgotten by the restaurant, and we chose to cancel it). Wow was that a mistake. The portions for many of the ones we ordered were huge! All except maybe the goat cheese dumplings, which we absolutely liked the most.

We ordered:
1. Sweet potato gnocchi
2. Goat cheese dumplings
3. Fried brussel sprouts
4. Kale caesar
5. Tuna poke bowl
(We cancelled the thai carrot and mango salad.) 

The best: goat cheese dumplings, followed by the sweet potato gnocchi. So rich and yummy.

If you're a drinker, the whiskey sour is a MUST to order. It may be the best whiskey sour I ever had. My boyfriend got it, and I immediately regretted my rosé wine choice. They can definitely be dangerous if you get more than 1!

The rest: nothing to write home about. The brussel sprouts were drenched in the cream. I tried to pour some of it out onto another plate, and it was just leaking sauce. My boyfriend liked the kale caesar, but it was nothing special to me. The tuna poke bowl? Seared tuna--not what you'd expect for poke IMO. 

We weren't in any rush, but be prepared to wait a little bit for your food, as they appeared to be understaffed but very busy. We thought we would have to wait for a table outside at first, given a sign indicating a 30-min wait when we arrived. However, there was plenty of outdoor seating in the back.

Hostess-think her name was Jennifer, was rude and wasted our time. We arrived and placed our name on the list. 10 minutes later she said it would be 15 min. The we were waiting and she came and said it would be  be 30 minutes and to go across the street and have a drink, since the bar was full. She said go to the southern across the street for a drink, we did and after our drinks were served 5 minutes later - she texted and said our table was ready. Really? This is not brain surgery.

The service gets worse. The older mature man who attended to us ""the waiter"" never even gave us his name and treated us like we were in a car in line at McDonald's. His lack of support and attention to detail really made the 1st time experience at Bang - average.  He was not interested, didn't listen and had no enthusiasm for the waitlisted culinary experience. When we asked him what suggestions, he rattled off the three most expensive items. Really?

To the chef: of the 12 items we ordered the kale tortellini, pork taco, chicken bun were the best. Your food rocks. Maybe consider opening a food truck and be done with the noise of an average restaurant. You're better that this.

The drinks here are amazing. The food is good portions to share. They hosted my bday get together with 10 of my friends and I. Everyone had a great time. The service was on point as always.

2022-01-16,5.0,"Bang! Leaves me practically speechless every time I go. The food is consistently amazing even when toying with the different menu options. 

The way Bang! operates is not a usual dining experience you may be used to. When your dish or your neighbors dish is ready, it comes to the table. There is no waiting to eat until everyone has their plate. This also encourages folks to get beyond just one dish since they are indeed small plates. It is a fun style. 

To start the meal, I had the curried hummus with sourdough naan. Unfortunately, I did not capture a picture of this. That speaks to the quality of the dish. Every bite was scrumptious from the warm naan to the hummus with a kick. It is a great starter and shareable between two folks I would estimate. 

For my ""main course"" I ordered the Korean Beef Empanada and Chicken Bun. Both of these were excellent. My personal favorite is the empanada which I will order every time regardless of what else I get. The beef quite literally melts in your mouth. The chicken bun is also very good and should not be overlooked! For $4 it is perfectly fine to get a handful of these as your whole meal. 

My friend also let me sample his tempura sweet potato. From my small portion, I was a fan. It was fried well but not to the point where you lose out on the sweet potato. 

For dessert I got the coconut chocolate mousse. Oh boy I'm glad I did. While it was slightly difficult to break apart with the Graham cracker crust/base, each bite was divine. It was essentially coconut chocolate mousse on top of a baked Graham cracker crust. So good! 

My friends also let me try the miso doughtnuts. These were good but my clear front runner is the coconut mouse . 

Finally, in terms of drinks, I had the Sin City and Esoresso Martini. Both of these were good but I really enjoyed the espresso. It tasted like a sweet coffee drink from a coffee shop and really does well to mask the alcohol in it. 

Bang! Is a great spot for all - dates to family night out I recommend you stop by.",156.0,Bang

2022-04-23,4.0,"3.5 stars. Rounding up bc so few decent places in Charlottesville with vegetarian and vegan options.

The ambiance is so blah. Are there no interior design students to come in on the cheap and through some decor around? Because of the barren space, It isnt nice enough for a date spot.

Here are the plant based items I ordered, from best to worst:

Black Pepper Tofu. I was afraid to order this worrying f that there would be too push black pepper but it wasn't. The sauce was medium spice and the black pepper flavor was mild. You get a great amount of tofu and broccoli. This really could be an entree if you added a side of rice. This dish is why I boosted to 4 stars.

Drunken Noodles. delicious sauce and tender noodles made this one of the best drunken Noodles dish I've ordered. Other places sometimes use a boring brown sauce but Bang uses a slightly more complex sauce. 

Mushroom Bao Bun. I thought all bao buns were the same until i tried this one. This was much more dense than the airy buns I've eaten at other places. The mushrooms were shitake and had an excellent flavor that was let down by the uninspired slaw on top.

Flash Fried Brussels. Don't get the mayo bc this isnt lightly fried - its deep fried so very greasy and the mayo adds no flavor. If you ask for it vegan you'll get a different sauce.

I would come back bc of so few vegan friendly dining options in C'ville.",682.0,Bang
2022-04-30,4.0,"Came here for a girls' night downtown for a round of Asian Fusion tapas! For four people, we ordered 8 plates (forgot to take pic of drunken noodles) and felt decently full after. 

My ranking of the plates from enjoyed the most to least:

-Korean boneless short ribs: meat was so tender and the sauce was delicious. I wished I could have ordered this whole plate for myself. The crispy noodles didn't add much to the dish in my opinion though 

-drunken oyster mushroom noodles: don't test like traditional Thai drunken noodles but still pretty yummy! I would get this again the next time I come 

-general tso's cauliflower: nice crunch and fried beautifully. I appreciated how hot the cauliflower were, it seemed like they were taken out right after they got fried and the sauce was very tasty 

- curried potato and cauliflower dumplings: reminds me of samosas; good seasoning in the filling and crunch

- black pepper tofu and broccoli: I really enjoyed the sauce that the plate came with; however, felt like the tofu could has been more crispy as it felt a bit soggy 

-mushroom steamed bun: honestly i was looking forward to these buns but they didn't give me as much flavor as i would have liked. The presentation of the buns is appealing though. 

-sweet potato gnocchi: this plate is definitely heavier than the other plates we ordered. I didn't enjoy it as much as the other plates we ordered 

-goat cheese dumplings: my friends enjoyed this dish but i felt like the cheese was too heavy for my personally especially with the fried dumpling wrapper",201.0,Bang
2022-05-22,4.0,"Wow this was surprisingly a very delicious meal! Only minor complaint is that food can come out at odd intervals and since this place is popular the staff can be a bit rushed and scattered with all the work they need to do.

My husband and I went hiking with another married couple and came here for dinner afterwards (on Saturday night). We luckily were able to get seated right away despite the place being packed. 

This place is so great for sharing! The four of us ordered:

- fried chicken & pork belly buns: 7/10 (pork was so tender!)
- sweet potato gnocchi: 8/10 very pillowy texture that grows on you as you eat it
- Korean short rib: 9/10 super tender and flavorful
- firecracker shrimp: 7/10 yummy but not that memorable 
- chicken spring roll: 10/10 everyone's favorite dish! The chicken was so juicy. We reordered because it was so good
- pear & avocado salad: 8/10 very refreshing and great to balance out a lot of the heavier dishes we got

I think we may have gotten a few more dishes but those were the most memorable ones.

2022-01-07,5.0,"We went to Bang for dinner last night based on a recommendation from our local friend. She and her husband love it and said Bang had great specials on Wednesday's, which they did!

I got the Not Your Mothers Mule, a mango mule with habanero syrup. The mango goes great with the kick. I'd say it's about a 6/10 on the heat scale. Not crazy spicy, but has a good kick. I'm not a very spicy person so if I could drink this so can you!

My boyfriend got the Calm Before (The Storm) - old fashioned with earl grey and walnut bitters. I loved the earl grey flavor! But it is a bit on the sweeter side for an old fashioned.

The food is tapas style, so we got a lot of food and we're completely stuffed by the end of the night. And I have no regrets other than I didn't have any room to get any cold Sake. Sad.

My favorites were the Shrimp Dumplings and Kale Tortellini. The tortellini were delicious! It was like a drunken noodle tortellini and the sambal brown butter sauce was the perfect pairing and gives it a tiny kick. The shrimp dumplings were a fried crispy dumpling, and I felt like it closer resembled to a taco/empanada than dumpling but they were AMAZING! I wanted to eat like 20 more. The spicy garlic mayo with the dark brown sweet drizzle was so good, even the cabbage slaw on the side was bomb! Definitely try these dumplings, they're to die for!

We also got the Thai Meatballs (my boyfriends favorite), Feta & Red Pepper Rangoons, & Pistachio Roasted Beets. Everything was delicious!

The waitress was nice to let the kitchen know that I worked night shift at 7pm (wearing my scrubs didn't give it away, did it?) and was able to queue me up as fast as able so I can enjoy this restaurant week to the end!  

Started off with a banger: Korean beef empanada with a miso Mayo on the side. Delicious! Enough said 

I forgot what this was but it was chill noodles, maybe the chilled Kung Pao veggie noodles. Refreshing and I was scarfing the down. Nice umami kick to a light tasting dish

Red pepper and feta rangoons were good! The cilantro sauce was a little too thin, otherwise very good 

Ginger pork dumplings in chili oil was great but slippery with chop sticks lol. Too spicy for my fiancée but perfectly spiced for me. 

The most anticipated dish for us was the flash fried Brussels with miso Mayo and sweet soy. It def tasted good, but maybe it was speedily made because it wasn't crisp, but instead it was soggy on the outside. Had it better the first time. 

Ginger crême brûlée IS THE BOMB FINISHER. Top 3 crême brûlée for me. 

Bottom line: None of these dishes came out in any particular order, so it was a nice surprise whenever each one came out. What makes this place special is that you can share your plates with those you sit with, so our table of 2 had 6 dishes to try out and it was the perfect number.

Perhaps we would have enjoyed it more if we ordered the salad, but hardly seems like our fault when over 2/3 of the menu was deep fried. The curried chickpea spring rolls were the only redeeming dish. I got the beef bbq enpanadas but didn't think it was as good as the yelp reviews made it out to be.

First of all I love Bang for the unique concept - Asian small plates. I loveee Asian food and trying lots of items so this was perfect for me. The ambiance is also quite nice, although at first we were seated at a table right next to the door where we basically shivered every time the door opened; we then asked to move to a table upstairs and got a much more intimate spot even though there was a short wait. 

I also LOVE that almost all dishes are vegetarian / vegan or gluten-free. I was able to try so much of the menu which I'm never able to do! I'll list some of the hits and some of the misses:

Hits: Goat Cheese Dumplings (eat these hot - I hate cilantro and still was fine with the cilantro sauce they come with), Fried Rice Balls (chewy, hearty, satisfying), Kale Tortellini, Brussels Sprouts 

Misses: Eggplant Noodles (hard to eat, not chewy as expected), Avocado Wontons (avocado fell out during frying apparently because ours were basically empty), Roasted Beets (pretty good but nothing mind-blowing)

Pros- easy for your group to order multiple different plates and share. Great drinks. Vegan, vegetarian, and Gluten free options. Everyone can find something they like. 

Cons- because of the different dishes, my friends got their food way before me. My friend was done with her food before mine came.

***LOCATION***
This restaurant is only a couple blocks away from the Charlottesville's Historic Downtown Mall. There is a parking lot in front of it that you have to pay for. However, if you come on a Sunday or after 6pm, it's free to park there.

***EXPERIENCE***
We were a group of four. The friends I went with love this place and were excited to order for us. It's an Asian fusion tapas place. The service is a bit strange here because they grab your menu (you mark what you want and how many dishes of it) and then they disappear. It felt like they were throwing the dishes on our table and running away. At one point, they threw a dish we didn't order and before we could say something, they were already gone. I had to flag down a waiter to let them know the dish must've been for someone else. Ignoring that, we had a great time. We ordered:

Tempura sweet potatoes with hot honey feta:
This was probably my favorite dish we ordered. It wasn't covered in any sauce and the hot honey feta really complimented the fried sweet potatoes.

Goat cheese dumplings with cilantro sauce:
A lot of reviews raved about this and I understand why. We ordered two of these (they come with four dumplings), but we were stuffed by the time they came out at the end. These were one of the best things we ordered. I loved the curry flavors of the cilantro sauce. It really complimented the goat cheese. The dumplings themselves were crunchy which was really nice.

Flash fried brussels with miso mayo and sweet soy:
The brussels sprouts still had a bit of a crunch which was nice, however this dish felt like it was drowning in the miso mayo.

Ahi tuna poke tacos, pineapple, edamame:
Felt a bit drowned in the mayo sauce. The crunch of the taco shell was nice. Loved all the colors in this dish and what they were going for.

Firecracker shrimp, spicy garlic sauce:
This dish is not spicy, but the fried shrimp is delicious. Another dish covered in sauce.

Red pepper & feta rangoons:
They had a nice crunch and felt like a yummy crunchy and cheesy snack. I appreciated the sauce on the side.

BBQ pork belly, miso mayo pickled daikon:
It's a bit hard to share one of their steamed buns, so we each got our own. I ordered this one and enjoyed it. The bun is very thick and filling. The pork belly was quite delicious.

I had mixed feelings about the food. Some things were pretty yummy and others were just fine. A lot of things had a bit too much sauce for my liking. I felt like there was A LOT of dairy in these dishes, but that's probably due to what my friends ordered.

***PRICE***
We split the bill four ways and paid about $36.

***BATHROOM***
I only noticed one single stall here. It was gender neutral. It had a bit of a smell, but was clean otherwise. 

***CONCLUSION***
I really love the concept and what they're going for here. Some dishes are great while others don't hit the mark for me. I'd still recommend checking out this restaurant and getting things like the goat cheese dumplings and the tempura sweet potatoes.",667.0,Bang

I'd highly recommend checking this spot out for restaurant week it's only $35 per person and the portions are huge.  We took home enough food for two more meals.  The top hits were the bulgogi beef lettuce wraps - super tender and the kimchi was on point.  The tiki masala was packed with flavor and the Nan was obviously homemade - airy and pillowy goodness.  The goat cheese dumplings didn't disappoint - I've had them before so I knew what to expect.  The pork spring rolls were a delight unto itself.  The mushroom noodles were not a highlight - needed more heat (I'd go with the firecracker shrimp instead in hindsight).  The Brussels sprouts came out first and were tasty - your typical fried Brussel sprouts so I can't say I thought they were anything special.  There was some confusion on what was included so we ended up with 2 deserts but the comped one - we took those along with a ton of leftovers to go.  All in all a wonderful meal.  I had the season mule which was tart with a little heat - very refreshing.  My date had the blackberry bourbon drink (don't remember the name) they thoroughly enjoyed it.

Goat cheese pierogis with cilantro sauce: as a fan of goat cheese, these were just missing something. Don't know what, the dough was cooked well but just felt incomplete. Cilantro sauce didn't have much flavor.

Smoked Salmon Naan: best item of the night in my opinion! Would have been good to have toasted the naan a bit. It was just cold naan cut up into pieces.

Bulgogi lettuce wraps: greasy, fell apart. Couldn't eat as a lettuce wrap and lacked bulgogi flavor. Moreso tasted like pot roast with kimchi. Still good, but not bulgogi.

Crab Wontons: good, sauce is very sweet but complemented the crab filling.

Kale tortellini: honestly, did not like these at all. I like kale, I like brown butter. These were not tortellini like I know them (those little round stuffed pasta guys). And the flavor was just not there. 

Hot honey chicken: verygood but not spicy at all. Could have used more sauce.",227.0,Bang
2024-09-02,5.0,Everything we ate was amazing. From the fried chicken to the cauliflower. The bao buns were perfection. Great service. Great food. Love how it has a homey historical vibe.,39.0,Bang
2024-02-15,5.0,The Asian fusion at BANG is excellent.  The small plate servings are great.  The BBQ beef short ribs tapas were great.  Chickpea egg rolls and brownie bite cheese cake were all great .  Christi our server made excellent suggestions.  Loved the experience as well! We highly recommend this restaurant.,1.0,Bang
2024-03-03,3.0,"I honestly thought this place was a bit overrated. The food was okay. I had two different bao buns. But it was crazy expensive, especially the 15$ drinks and it was nearly impossible to get the servers attention. It seemed like they didn't want to interact at all and I would have to basically yell excuse me in order to ask a question before they ran from the table. There is an automatic gratuity added to the bill and the servers seem to take that as an excuse to avoid helping. Overall mid.",8.0,Bang
2024-04-03,4.0,"Came to Bang! For a friend's birthday dinner, we had a section reserved for about 9 people upstairs. Our section was cozy but very roomy. This is a unique experience as you check off items from a paper, give the paper to the server and they bring out your dishes. They offer a variety of vegetarian/non vegetarian dishes and a large cocktail menu. The lighting was really dark so I couldn't take good photos without an obnoxious flash but the food was very good! We ordered a pork bun, pickles, furikake edamame, firecracker shrimp, and the mushroom drunken noodles. Their menu did vary from the menu online. Each bun is $4 and the portion size is worth it in my opinion. I was a little dissapointed with the pickles, I thought it would be a variety of pickled veggies but it was just a little bowl of pickled cucumbers. The shrimp and drunken noodles were amazing!! Edamame were so so. This is a great place for groups in my opinion they offer something for everyone!!",122.0,Bang

Our first tapa came out before I had anything to drink, and I only got it because I asked the bartender. An hour later, as we patiently wait for the rest of our tapas to arrive, the waitress asks if we need anything. I told her we were just waiting for our last two tapas. She gives a surprised look, says nothing else, then goes back to the kitchen. 15 minutes after that one of the tapas arrives. Another 15 for the tapa after that, and by this point, they actually have the waiter and food runner checking if we are still waiting for our short ribs. Not sure what was going on. Lots of employees walking around and not a lot of tables for a slow 6pm Wednesday dinner. Not worth the trouble going here.",9.0,Bang
2024-04-26,2.0,"watered down asian food, if you can even call it that, that is made specifically for white people

korean bbq lettuce wraps taste nothing like korean bbq. seasoned with what tastes like mccormick steak seasoning lol. just because there's sesame on it doesn't make it ""korean""

popcorn shrimp was pretty good i won't lie

goat cheese dumplings were horrendous in my opinion, but if you like goat cheese then you'd probably like it

chicken was meh

i guess if you're white and don't normally have asian food to understand what's good and what isn't then you'd probably enjoy it but if you're looking for actual asian food and not whatever the hell this is just go to maps and look at the ten other asian restaurants in a 500 feet radius. two stars because the shrimp was actually not bad and the waiter was nice",5.0,Bang
2024-05-17,3.0,"Very interesting flavors here at Bang. It truly is a fusion restaurant. Not sure what happened, but everything we ordered was fried. Oops! Our party of two ordered five dishes to share. We had the Chickpea Spring Rolls, General Tso's Cauliflower, Goat Cheese Dumplings, Avocado Wontons, and Pork Belly Rice. My personal favorites were the cauliflower and pork belly. In fact, the pork belly is to die for. Incredible flavors and went well with the hot and crispy rice. Cauliflower was nice and crispy too. The other dishes were just okay. I would describe the spring rolls as a very tiny Samosa wrapped like a roll. The sauce is the same sauce you would get with an Indian Samosa. Avocado Wontons and the Dumplings were okay.
 
Service was fast. Ordering is simple, but not the most interactive method. Very little communication with the servers, but receipt starts tip at 20%. So am I tipping based on just food? It was busy out and not a ton of parking in the area. There are several lots for paid parking.",1268.0,Bang
2024-05-25,5.0,"When I tell you...this place is always worth the trip. I remember coming here in college when it was more of a sushi bar with plenty of alcohol to keep you going all night long. 
The menu is more Asian fusion meets tapas and the flavors do not disappoint. 
The food comes out very quickly, so come hungry and order like you mean it. 

They've got something for the Asian adventurous as well as those who like to play it safe. Vegan friendly and gluten-free friendly options also. 

I highly recommend: 

General Tso's cauliflower 
Drunken noodles 
Beef short rib bao buns 
Mushroom bao buns 
Coconut rice 
Crab wontons 

Not a big fan of... the chickpea spring rolls and the mushroom wontons.

2024-08-25,2.0,"Asian fusion tapas sounded like a fun idea, so we visited Bang! on a Saturday night. We were seated quickly and ordered the pickles, pork belly bao, fried chicken bao, tempura zucchini, and pork belly friend rice. We really wanted to like this place, but it ended up being gross. The bao buns were totally raw in the center and looked more like pallid bean bags than sandwiches. Most of the tempura batter on the zucchini had run off, leaving the scalding hot vegetable with a few chunks of burnt dough clinging to the edges. The fried rice was the best dish we tried, but $18 for an appetizer-sized bowl of rice left a different kind of bad taste in our mouths. The lukewarm warm tap water was a welcome, if underwhelming, relief from the food. Our waiter was friendly and prompt.",1.0,Bang
2024-10-09,4.0,"Loved dinner here on Tuesday! It wasn't that busy, easily sat on the front porch and people watched. The ambiance is very cute and pretty laid back - it's in a renovated house with indoor, front porch, and back porch seating.

It's tapas style with delicious drinks! The portion sizes are pretty large - they recommended ~2 a person but maybe 1.5 would be fine. There are plenty on options for vegan and gluten free. There's also street parking!

Best items:
Drinks! I got the strawberry moon and it was fantastic so fresh!
General Tso's Cauliflower: not too fried or sauced, you can still taste the cauliflower which I appreciate
Beets: perfectly cooked

Our server was helpful and got us going with drinks. You mark off what you'd like to eat and then they bring it out ""tapas style"" as it's ready. 

The building is a house, so we were sitting likely in the living room (lol). It's quirky, and I wish we could've sat outside. But it was good! This is a good spot for a date night or dinner with a few friends (more so than large groups). 

They do not have hot sake, which we were hoping for on a cold night. My only other complaint, and really it's a me thing, was that food came out really fast. We wanted to sit and enjoy the drinks, the food, the company. We were scrambling to finish and make room on our tiny two-top. 

Small thing! I'm sure it works for others... I'm a slower eater.

The pulled pork quesadillas were so cheesy and so juicy. The drinks weren't super strong but they were delicious. Loved the pomegranate sangria, it was very refreshing.

Definitely a large portion. We got the Barbacoa and honey sriracha shrimp. The shrimp was heavy on the sriracha so warning for those who can't tolerate heat. The barbacoa was great but we wish the meat came out shredded instead of in chunks. The margs were also great. Definitely recommend this spot!",409.0,Asado

Will preference that I don't know much about Mexican food so I can't claim any authenticity.

I got the potato taco (I totally forgot the name) and thought it was a perfect size for one person. Flavor was good as well! The food came out pretty quickly, service was great, and I loved the atmosphere on a Friday night.

I get it, it's busy, and she wants to keep it moving.. but to me it seemed like she was rushing us.. food was okay, I've had better tacos. The tortilla was cold i don't know if this is usually how they do there tacos.

The food in the other hand is GOOD but not on par with one in Richmond yet. However, I would say the staff and service is way better than the one in richmond so it balances out.

I love the chori pollo taco but you really can't go wrong with any of them. The also have amazing wings and a variety of sauces (of varying spice levels) to choose from.

Inside it's what you would expect for a sports bar. There are lots of TVs for watching UVA basketball games (and other games too). The staff is always willing to help and super friendly.

The Dos Amigos is also a good deal, which gets you 6 wings and a taco for like $11-$12 any day. I usually just get the Barbacoa taco, which has always been a solid choice.

Service: I think a lot of the servers are UVA undergrads, so they're all pretty chill and good about coming to your table to check-in. Bree/Bri (not sure how to spell it) has always been extremely polite, even when we've come in as a large and rowdy group. The bartender here is always very polite, attentive and just a fun guy.

We ended up getting the chips and queso and the loaded Cajun fries to start with, both were good. The chips were super crunchy and went well with the queso, but honestly I was more into the loaded Cajun fries. The fries itself had good seasoning, and pairing that with the jalapeños and queso made for a great combination. 

Then we got our tacos. I ended up getting the honey sriracha shrimp taco and the pineapple teriyaki shrimp taco. (I had them both with fried shrimp) The honey sriracha one was surprisingly spicy and it was balanced out with the more sweet pineapple teriyaki shrimp taco. Both were good and I'd definitely recommend giving those two a shot.

I always get the taco salad with honey lime dressing--it's so filling because of all the toppings and a great price point. If I add shrimp it usually lasts me two meals. I also really like their quesadillas because there's a solid amount of cheese and I like the vegetarian (mushroom) option. I've only had a taco once and it was tasty but I sort of wish they were smaller tacos. 

People rave about the chips--for me they're a little too thick but I still enjoy eating their nachos (because I love the queso). I also think their French fries are overly salted. 

Overall the atmosphere is great. They have good deals on food and drinks, karaoke is fun, and they have a lot of fun drinks (I really enjoy the frozen margaritas).",157.0,Asado

Finally, a very nice server saw what was going on as she was rolling silver and decided to take charge, greet and seat me... thank you whoever you are.

Anyway, moving on...

Ordered the Dip sampler, buffalo wings and Chori Pollo Taco

Dip sampler... was missing 1/3 of the sample because they ran out of guacamole... WTF, guess it's not made to order for sure.  Anyway, chips are really good but could use more salt... queso is ok... kinda like bland cheese with a slow-arriving bit of heat afterwards... salsa pretty decent 

Taco for me could have been an immediate fail because no corn tortillas... but when it was described as ""Jumbo"" I wasn't expecting corn.  When it arrived (as you can see from the pics) a lot of lettuce, not so much meat... well, that's what I thought h 'til biting into it.  Pretty dang amazing flavor.

The wings were good... them being grilled added a little something to them beyond the usual.

As a follow up to the initial experience at hosts stand, the staff (including the hostess pretending not to see me) were all on task and welcoming.

I got the brisket burrito and it was GOOD with creamy delicious queso smothered all over it. I'm use to having chips and salsa and a giant burrito with sides when it comes to eating out, but all those extras are extra $. The chip and dip sampler came with this awesome salsa and super crunchy chips to dip, yet the queso could have been a little thicker and the guac lacked oomf. My other table mates both got the dos amigos and tried both styles of wings with spicy garlic being the winner. I got to try a bite of the chorizo chicken taco and that was exploding with flavor in my mouth! And the honey sriracha shrimp taco was good and spicy, too!

We just visited yesterday for the first time expecting a nice meal and a few drinks and was shocked by how disgustingly rude the managerial staff was. Our waitress was absolutely wonderful and very sweet but after a horrible experience with the kitchen and manager I will never return. 

We waited more than an hour and a half for our food. It was a busy night and after our appetizer, they brought one entree out 40 minutes before the rest of the food was served. One meal was completely incorrect and another cold. Our waitress said the manager agreed to give us half off our meal for the inconvenience,  then brought three incorrect bills to the table- none half off. After asking for a manager 4 times someone finally came to the table (who was clearly not a manager) to talk to us. The whole time I was explaining what happened and trying to get a correct bill, he spent rolling his eyes and looking at the bar. 

Then comes the actual manager storming over to our table and proceeded to throw a tantrum, screaming in my face , slamming his hands down on our table and even crumpling the bill and throwing it in my 16 year old sisters face. He told us to leave and never return since we refused to pay the bill (which I never once did). Once he shut up long enough for me to explain what actually happened he apologized for his behavior and the misunderstanding and we left. 

However I will NEVER return to an establishment that thinks it's ok to treat customers like that, even in a frustrating and heated situation. Mangers are meant to be keeping their cool and leading their team not throwing tantrums and screaming at customers for THEIR lack of understanding the of situation. Truly disgraceful.",1.0,Asado

Our server brought waters right away and took our orders quickly. Most of the guys got the Dos Locos Tacos which came with a taco and wings. It was a lot of good, and they all said how tasty the wings are. I shared a Baja fish taco and honey sriracha shrimp taco with my husband...they were both quite large and more than enough food for the two of us.

If you want to avoid that maybe go to the downtown mall instead of the corner. 

Food wise, Asado is great. The wings here are unbreaded and smoked till the skin is crispy then spun graciously in sauce. I usually get the em with spicy Buffalo sauce which is pretty spicy but not to the point where it's all heat and no flavor. Indisputably the best wings Ive had in Charlottesville.

The tacos here are also very good. I'm a huge fan of the smoked pork taco which has both pineapple coleslaw and jalapeños on it which combines for a very satisfying sweet and spicy dynamic. The tacos are pretty big so if you aren't super hungry one taco might be enough food.

We asked what happened to our friend's order and the server rolled their eyes and said that they ""didn't write it down"". So we obviously were annoyed and sat there and waited for my friend's order. The server came with the food and just dropped it in front of my friend spilling the contents inside the tacos and walked away without saying anything. After eating, we were all splitting the check and we simply just wanted the total to be split into three but when the server came back all the prices were extremely different even though we all ordered the same thing. This back Ajax forth happened multiple times and I was fed up and offered to just pay the whole thing and have my friends Venmo me back but my friend asked the server for the manager and the server looked upset and annoyed at this request. What annoyed me the most is that every time the server set down our ""split checks"" they were smirk at us as if they knew what they were doing and got a laugh at our annoyed reactions - really uncalled for. Thankfully, the manager was able to help us out with the checks. I have a hard time emphasizing with the server because I would understand if they were new, having a bad day, etc. but just the overall judgmental and childish attitude of the server ruined our moods. 

The food was delicious which definitely lighten up the mood. We shared pineapple teriyaki wings and honey bbq boneless wings. I usually don't like boneless but in this case I actually preferred the boneless because the chicken was extremely tender and juicy and honey bbq is always a fav. I got the pineapple teriyaki shrimp (fried) tacos and they were the perfect mixture of sweet, savory, and tanginess. My friends absolutely enjoyed their tacos as well. 

We will happily come back to asados in hopes that we don't get served by the same server.",41.0,Asado

On to the specifics:
Honey siracha taco was pretty good. I'm ngl, it was a bit overhyped from what my friends told me but that doesn't invalidate it as still a good taco. It's a simple tangy sweet and spicy flavor loaded with toppings. Shrimp was grilled extremely well.

Pineapple teriyaki taco was my favorite. It hits you with that one two jab of sweet and savory and knocks you out with a mild Smokey after taste.",30.0,Asado

There were 8 people total for a birthday dinner and we just wanted to chat for a little before ordering. A few people were missing items/got extra, but it was corrected ok. One of my friends mentioned to him that it was my birthday, assuming that he would bring a birthday shot like she got just a month ago for hers, but he said they don't do anything for birthdays and left. When he came back 3 of the people asked him to clarify (saying they did it a month ago) and he said he would have to card everyone at the table. Huh? He then brought 4 birthday churros which each person had 1/2 of one. Food went fine. When he brought my credit card back to me with the receipts to sign, he said they had a waitlist and could we please leave in 10 minutes. That had never happened to me before- if anything, I've been told an hour in advance that a restaurant was having a busy night. We were all pretty shocked, especially since there was no one waiting in the lobby area. Because we had a big enough party tip was added for me, and we were so unnerved that we left quickly after. As we were all gathering our stuff and making our way away from the table he was watching us- I assume to clean up the table as soon as the last person walked away. All in all, food was good but service was not- coming from someone's who's worked in a restaurant before.",2.0,Asado

We did order fish tacos that could've used more fish, but the flavor was still good. The wings are smoked then seasoned and they are seasoned well! The cheesesteak egg rolls are my fave! The queso dipping sauce that they're served with just adds to to the ""yumminess"". And the Cajun fries..... omg!!  Definitely a ""do not share dish""! I usually don't like spicy, but these aren't overly spicy. Just the right amount of kick at the end. Our service wasn't anything to rave about. We got what we needed when we needed it. Also, most of the staff are students, so I don't hold anything against them. It's a little loud inside, but overall a great environment.

My must get is the lemon pepper chicken wings because it is so flavorful but this time I felt that the seasoning was a little lacking. I tried the loaded Cajun fries for the first time and I expected it to have more toppings such as pico de gallo but it was really good! The Baja fish tacos is reliable and I always get it fried. I also tried the double smoked bacon and chicken for the first time and it was really delicious. I was pleasantly surprised. I'd still come here but I do feel that the quality went down a bit. The service is good, despite it always being busy when I come. I sat outside this time and they do have heaters so it wasn't too bad. Also if you get a drink get the frozen margarita with the sour patch rim.

We had ordered two orders of boneless wings which had seemed like they had been in a fryer all day. They were VERY burnt and unpleasant to eat, we couldn't even finish them because of how hard and burnt they were. The price seemed very high for what we were served.

Food took forever, and the wings were dry and tasted like they were microwaved. I've been here multiple times and the food is okay at best, but it's expensive if you don't go during a day where they have a deal. Drinks are either way too light or way too heavy, and super expensive for what you get. Glorified bar food with the same prices as DC (mid at best), overpriced Margaritas, and pretty terrible service. Would not recommend even on wing Wednesday or margarita Monday.

For appetizers we had the charred octopus which was tender and charred perfectly.  The tomato salad had a very thinly sliced and peeled tomato topped with peeled cherry tomatoes, strawberries, cheese, thin sliced sourdough crisps and greens with a pomegranate vinaigrette. The beef skewers melted in your mouth and are made with local beef.

We were excited to see manti dumplings on the menu knowing they are time consuming to make. The perfect choice for a vegetarian meal.

The burger, from local beef, was cooked perfectly as ordered and the aioli and sumac onions were a bonus. The tasty house fries were perfectly prepared served with homemade ketchup for dipping.

For dessert we chose the panna cotta and almond frangipane both of which the flavors were perfectly balanced.

Most recently we ordered the rib-eye for 2. We were warned before that it takes the longest of any item on the menu to cook so expect a decent wait time (I think it was 40ish minutes) but it was WELL worth it. The steak was beautifully cooked. The sides complimented it perfectly. Our waiter showed us the steak before it was sliced for us - it just felt really nice to see how proud the restaurant was of their food and have it translate so well into an excellent tasting meal! The staff has always been incredible and welcoming every time we've visited. 

We also love their house made sparkling water. Such a Euro vibe lol! There is an extra fee to it (I think $2?) but it's added just a bit more sparkle to the dining experience.

It is narrow menu, inhabiting the past Bella's/Mangione, dramatically redone but reserving its
special tin(?) ceiling.

The meze trio, a shared starter was most notable for its properly charred eggplant; it takes a proper flame to get that flavor, a broiler will not do.   Excellent bread, described to us as made onsite. Quite so.

Manti dumplings, special, but not quite as much so as suggested...?

The fish dish 'guvec' , was a fennel based filet atop shrimp.  The fish properly prepared, just so, and the shrimp good. Perhaps to mimic a fresh caught fish you'd be served at a waterside restaurant on the Bosphorus. 

A curious baklava cheescake 'stack', unique.

I will admit that I am definitely more partial to the giant cooked meat Turkish spreads you may have to travel abroad to eat ( and dream of thereafter ), or the infinite dishes at Develi, the kunefe at Sultan Kebab, an excellent adana, or a cold doganay salgam to drink...

Everyone who helped us from the host, to the bartender, to the people delivering the food was both friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely some of the better service we've had recently.

The service was outstanding from the hostess, our waiter, the bartender, and even the chef dropped by our table.  

We had their craft cocktails to start. After cocktails, we had the farmers bread, which is part sourdough and made with grain from a local mill. Next, it was the fried calamari (with a cucumber dill sauce) and charred octopus (with a reduction sauce that was off the chart!), both were amazing. 

For our mains, we had a chicken skewer and a burger. My wife loved the chicken skewer with a little slight heat that she really enjoyed. The burger was cooked perfectly, the fries were straight out of the fryer, and crispy.  

For our dessert, we had something that is not on the menu yet, but the chef said it may be coming soon. The dessert was strawberries, with meringue, Turkish cotton candy, and Meyer lemon granita. I have to say that It was the most amazing dessert I've ever eaten. 

It was by far one of, if not the best place we've eaten in, in Charlottesville.

2023-12-08,5.0,"Oh my God, I was completely blown away by this place. I have tried a lot of different Mediterranean places and upscale restaurants, but this is by far one of my top three restaurants that I have ever tried. Not only was the service amazing, and the ambience super eclectic, but the food was out of this world.

We started by ordering what the waiter recommended, and it was great because he actually knew everything about the process and where the food came from which I really appreciate when I ask the waiter what they recommend. First was a variety of oysters from different parts of the country and then bread came with different Middle Eastern dips and that was absolutely phenomenal as well as a cold soup (fyi they do charge for each extra bread you order sadly). We started to order a bunch of entrées and each one had so many different flavors and textures that we finished everything on the plate. I was even very happy to see that their mocktails and non-alcoholic beverages were abundant, and when it came out, it was as pretty as my friends who got cocktails.

The desserts that we got were out of this world. There was one with a Turkish cotton candy style flavoring that melted in our mouth, which I don't think I will ever forget. The experience was amazing and the restaurant even let us sit late because it started storming outside. 

The only parking is on the street so you may have to walk a couple blocks based on how crowded it is in the area. I cannot wait to go back.",38.0,Smyrna

Manti dumplings (amazing little mini dumplings), chicken kabob (delicious seasoning), seafood main (SO MUCH juicy seafood & dippable jus), calamari in fluffy tempura-like batter, lamb kabob, heirloom tomorrow salad, mezze...great crusty bread & we appreciated the complimentary gazpacho to kick things off.

2023-09-25,1.0,"This place is all hype.  I brought my mother here on her birthday and it was so disappointing! The decor is swanky -- dim lights, cool music, nice bar.  So lots of mood points, but zero food points.  We ordered the charred octopus and the meze trio to start, followed by lamb skewers, manti dumplings and fisherman guvec. For drinks, we had the kusco poison. The meze trio was blah--hummus and tzatziki/labneh seemed sourced out of packets, the eggplant was smoky but otherwise unremarkable in flavor.  I baked better bread at home over the pandemic than what came with the dips.  The drink was mostly champaign with a hint of something yuzu/citrous, but just too subtle to be lively. The worst part was the 40 min. wait before the mains arrived.  The octopus was hard as a rubber hose.  We were starving so we ate it. The rest of the items were passable, but nothing that Public Oyster, Mas, Orzo, Tavola, Oakhart Social, Petit Pois, C&O, and even Maya two doors down can't serve equivalents of in a heartbeat.  The fish was the best item if I had to choose--it was perfectly cooked and the broth was complex. There is a rhythm to Aegean meze that involves generous quantities of tasty bites, some savory, some tart or sweet with delicate textures and light broths.  Accompanied by lightly charred fishes and meats and some fragrant drinks.  All doled out at a perfect pace.  This place didn't come close to that dance.  For the prices, Sultan Kebab (its sister restaurant) serves up fare that is actually worth what they charge.  The chef was very gracious.  Insisted on giving us a baklava cheesecake to make up for the disastrous octopus and the endless wait, but that cloying block of honey drenched pastry didn't make up for the lackluster experience.  I grew up on Mediterranean food in that part of the world and this is nothing like it.  Cville has too many good restaurants for this to be as buzzy as it is.",25.0,Smyrna

The chicken ""skewers"" were flavorful, tasty medallions of roast chicken with a red (paprika?) sauce that added another layer to the experience. Manti dumplings were tiny and plentiful and well-paired with a sour (yogurt?) sauce.

We got the olives, the mezze trio and the beet salad. The olives and all the dips were phenomenal. Both the regular bread and the gluten free bread were delicious. The beet salad, however, was bad. I would not order it ever again anywhere. 

My husband and I split the three skewers. All of them were delicious. That was some of the most moist chicken I've ever had anywhere. The beef was good, nothing special. The lamb meatballs were really yummy.

Also, tried the chicken skewers for the first time. I was a bit disappointed because their menu can change seasonally, and I was banking on trying the beef skewers but they're no longer on the menu. (Lamb is still an option, though.) However, the chicken didn't let me down. They have an impressive char flavor and are juicy and flavorful. Even the garnish and sauce were incredible.

My only thought in improvement was very minor, and I feel like I'm splitting hairs with this one. The gazpacho, although delicious, I wished packed a bit more of that tart/sour cherry flavor advertised on the menu.

The complimentary hummus and bread was delicious. The bread was soft and the hummus was mixed just right. The bruschetta was beautifully prepped and very satisfying as well!

My two gripes would be the olive oil poached tuna appetizer was really dry and likely way over cooked.  The dish was good, just the texture of the tuna unpleasant and kinda just  can-esque.

I am not sure if their menu is limited due to COVID but for a place that says it serves tapas, I was confused on their limited amount of tapas. I did like the patatas bravas as they were really spicy and perfectly cooked. I got spaghetti with meat sauce which was decent but nothing to write home about. Their sangria was good but definitely not the best. Overall, a pretty good date spot and would be interested in trying some of their other offerings.",1297.0,Orzo

I found one of the hosts who answered the phone a bit rude and told me to do everything online (which I had already done, but had trouble modifying), luckily another host a different day worked with us. Our food was great, and despite mixed reviews on the haloumi cheese, we enjoyed it. The octopus salad was nothing impressive, but all the entrees were tasty. I was actually shocked by the price point and serving size and expected a bit more. And all the decent bottles of wines were $50+. My lamb shank ragout was the favorite- so tender! The strip steak came in close second in my opinion, and the sword fish and bucatini satisfied those who ordered them. And of course- there were no leftovers!",437.0,Orzo
2020-10-27,3.0,"A five minute drive from the Inn we are staying at while in the area for a few days. It is in the center of Old town Charlottesville. Parking was easy and free. We parked in the back and surprised some folks by entering in through the back door of the place. 

You could eat indoor or outside we chose outside on the smallish patio area about 6 tables right on the street. It was 64F a calm evening. There were two other groups out there. The inside was not too crowded but we did see many patrons waiting for their take out orders. It was about 645p on a Monday. 

Service was good. We ordered hummus & a Caesar salad to start and risotto pescatore and pork ragout pappardelle. The hummus was very good. My wife loved her risotto. She commented that this was one of the few places that removed the shell from the shrimp tails that she could remember. Seems every where we go from fancy to not the chefs never remove the shells from the tails.

My ragout was unremarkable. It was good enough for comfort food but could have used a bit more flavor. 

We got a few glasses of wine, an Albariño and a Nebbiolo. Both were good. 

It is a nice place for a decent meal. Total $144 with tip. Ok value.

The food was STELLAR! We had the duck breast, peasant beef, and cheese plate. Everything was delicious and left us wanting more.

We made reservations, but arrived early and they were able to seat us right away. 

Our server Annie was new on the job and apologized in advance but that was not needed as she was super sweet, attentive and helpful!

She brought out olives for us to enjoy before, but no bread since I let her know I was gluten free. 

For gluten free options, they do not have a gf pasta, but any of meats can be prepared gf and the risotto is gluten free. 

We enjoyed sangria and when Annie asked if we were from Cville, we told her no and we were visiting on vacation so she recommended several spots. 

My friend had the spring vegetable salad and loved the lentils on the salad and ate every bit of her Calamarata alla Norma.  I enjoyed the Risotto Primavara.

The Lamb itself was superb. Lamb is my favorite meat, so I obviously have high standards for it. Orzo's dish was so tender I didn't even need a knife to cut it.

Our party of 6 had an early dinner reservation, and we weren't quite hungry enough for a meal when we got there but somehow managed to eat a TON of food. It was that delicious! To be honest, nothing on the menu really stood out to me at first but EVERYTHING we ordered was so appetizing and amazing.

We started with the mussels as an appetizer and the broth was so rich and sausage-y. We also got the haloumi cheese and hummus apps... everything was sooo good that we ordered another full loaf of bread and oil to dip in all of the leftover broth, cheese, and hummus. Even the olive oil was the best oil I've ever tasted. Our sirloin steak, pork tenderloin, and rigatoni bolognese entrees were really great too and so flavorful. Tiramisu and drinks did not disappoint either, although I wasn't a big fan of the sangria. Would def come here again, and I found that this place was only one of a few that opens on Sunday and Monday evenings in Cville.",292.0,Orzo
2021-10-31,5.0,"We were visiting my son in Charlottesville and he recommended the Orzo for dinner so we gave it a try.  It was a great call!  I'm going to concentrate on my dish but before I do I just want to praise the hummus a bit.  We actually ordered two hummus dishes - we had one as an appetizer with the baguette, and my wife had a hummus order but substituted grilled flatbread instead of the baguette.  Haven't had hummus on a baguette before but it was fun and delicious.  Of course what made it great was the hummus - very flavorful, light and fresh.  We ate every drop of the hummus and all loved it.
 
My dish was the Smoked Pork Tenderloin.  It was fantastic.  The chef had laid down the butternut squash puree with the chili fennel rub/bulgur pilaf on top, and the green apple relish on the side (see photo).  I started with the rub/pilaf/puree and the explosion of flavors was just incredible.  So delicious!  And the apple relish had a wonderful, light, minty(?), refreshing flavor but was chopped into very small little cubes so that it was also a delight to chew.  Mixing the relish in with the rub/pilaf/puree was just a flavor smorgasbord.  

Then there was the tenderloin.  Very tender, not a bit of fat on it, cooked perfectly, and with a strong and delicious smoked flavor.  It would have been delicious all by itself, but with the accompanying delights just mentioned, it was out of the park!   Couldn't have been happier with the tenderloin, it was the best I've ever had.
 
The only knock I have on the Orzo was the list of entrees is a bit short.  I suspect they keep it short to concentrate on what they serve, and they did an outstanding job on my tenderloin, but newcomers may have an easier time selecting something with a couple more choices.  All in all, it was just outstanding and I can't wait to go back.",34.0,Orzo

Prosciutto bruschetta was SO good. A must have. I could've eaten only those for the whole meal and would be okay with that. My boyfriend had a bolognese which was very fragrant and yummy. The squid pasta was also very good. The squid was very tender and softer than the noodle. There was no fishy smell or taste and it paired very well with the wine that our waitress so kindly suggested to us. The cake was also very good and moist.

I started with their Greek salad from their specialty menu and it was outstanding! Next I moved on to their hummus, which comes with their freshly made baguette and it was great! The texture of the hummus was a little more coarse than I prefer, but the flavor was great and the baguette was excellent too.

Their Red Wine Braised, Calamarata Squid Pasta dish was very interesting! The taste and spice of chorizo and smoked paprika was mostly what I experienced and I really enjoyed it. The squid was cooked perfectly and wasn't hard nor rubbery. For dessert I enjoyed their Pot de crème and it was outstanding! While there I tried a glass of wine and a cocktail and enjoyed both.

2022-06-19,5.0,"This was our first time dining at Orzo and it was simply incredible! The main thing we raved about (both during and long after dinner) was how flavorful all of the food was. 

The Food
Our sever recommended the grilled halloumi cheese and I would be lying if I said we still aren't thinking about it 3 days later. Such a unique and delicious dish--I wound up drinking the remaining broth with a spoon, it was THAT good! I indulged in the summer orecchiette pasta which was so light and flavorful with delightful pops of broccolini, tomato, and chickpeas. The lemon ricotta was subtle and added just enough creaminess to the dish without making it too overwhelming. My boyfriend ordered the spice rubbed pork chop and we both agreed it was the most delicious pork chop we've ever tasted! The crunchy sear bursting with flavor perfectly complimented the juicy interior--it was quite an experience. We also had a small tray of appetizers olives which will surpass anything you'll buy jarred in a grocery store. I could have snacked on them all day. We wrapped up dinner with a classic tiramisu, perfectly portioned to share between the two of us. Lastly, I ordered the Napoleon's Loss cocktail with perfect ratios of tequila, ginger, and lemon. A nice heavy pour and tasty candied ginger garnish--delish! 

The Service
We absolutely loved our server and I am so sad I don't remember his name. He was so pleasant, accommodating, and knowledgeable of the menu. We have absolutely no complaints. Early in the night, a different server dropped off a drink saying it was the Napoleon's Loss, but within seconds of me about to sip it, I believe it was the manager who ran over and told me it was wrong drink and quickly went to get me the right one. The level that the staff cares about their customers was abundantly clear, and we felt very well taken care of.

The Space
Parking was a breeze. We parked in the lot next to the building and didn't have any issues finding a spot at 6:30pm on a Friday. There was a shaded patio which looked airy and fun, but I had made our reservation for inside. The inside was intimate in appearance and a little loud with the acoustics, but it was not difficult to still enjoy our anniversary date.

2022-08-02,4.0,"Delicious food, good service and nice atmosphere. We chose this for a Friday night on a girls' weekend trip and vibe felt just right.  The pace is pretty slow, which was fine for our group. 

One reason this loses a star is two of us ordered cocktails that weren't great. I got the pasionaria, which is somewhat like a margarita with tequila, elderwater flower liquor and rimmed in harissa salt. I didn't like the salt at all and would have greatly preferred a simpler margarita. My friend got the ravello and she didn't like it. I took one sip and it jerked me back; I was expecting a strong lemon flavor but it was just like an alcohol burn without any pleasant flavor. 

Now, the peasant beef and pork bolognese was so good! The portion was smaller than I expected (all entree servings were), but it was rich and enough for me and I would definitely order again.

For dessert, we shared a chocolate pot de creme and omg! Again, it looked pretty small to share at our table, but it was so rich. I think I made a verbal yum sound after each bite.",215.0,Orzo

I worked in the restaurant service for several years. I understand what it's like when patrons are rude or entitled. For what it's worth, we were not like that. We just walked inside a dark and totally unoccupied restaurant. Not another soul around.

We came in recently for a date night, and noticed the food hasn't quite kept up. The grilled halloumi cheese appetizer was fabulous, but the entrees leave much to be desired. We had the lamb shank bourguignon and the grilled prime sirloin steak and unfortunately both were just meh. The lamb was cooked very well, but our overall impression was they were both pretty boring. The flavors were run of the mill. I will dream about the pork medallions I had last year - one of the best meals I've had. Until that comes back, the rest of their entrees seem to be good, but not great.

The service continues to be fabulous, every time I've been our server has been great.

Our appetizers were delicious, definitely the best appetizers I have ever had at any restaurant. The only reason I am giving Orzo four starts is due to the lamb. I love lamb and was excited to try the dish. Unfortunately it lacked some crucial components to some of the flavors it was trying to present. Perhaps the appetizers set the bar too high...but with a bit more touch of love, the entree would have been great. Definitely would comeback!",21.0,Orzo
2023-03-11,3.0,"Mayne 3.5 but I wasn't impressed. I saw this place referenced in some.bligs and the star rating seemed good so I gave it a try. It's a nice looking place and would be perfect for a night out. Service was very friendly and helpful. However, the items I got were not good. I started w the sangria of the day. I've had sangria in my home state and in Spain and this tasted like red wine w club soda. Wasn't tasty at all. I got the half baguette w the bolognese pasta. This isn't the only establishment I've been to thay foes this but I'll never understand places that charge close to $30+ for pasta and give a small portion so that was off putting.

The bruschetta appetizer is especially delicious. I get it every time. But something was different about this last visit. We arrived 12 minutes early for our 7:30 reservation, and were told quite firmly that we would be seated no earlier than 7:30. Ok, not a problem. So we sat at the completely empty bar to wait the 12 minutes. The host then offered my wife a menu, which she declined. The host then said it won't get us seated any faster. Really? Why are you treating us like we did something wrong? It's not like we were 12 minutes LATE for the reservation. Thank you but we can do without the attitude. Once seated, we decided to order our appetizers while we decided on the entrees. The waiter told us we couldn't do that. He said we had to order everything at the same time. Seriously? In decades of dining out, I've never had that happen before. While the food is excellent, we prefer to dine somewhere where we feel welcome.

They even printed the menus as placecards and allowed me to customize the heading, which was such a special touch. Our group was seated in a private loft area which made the dinner so intimate and special. Service was amazing, friendly, and attentive, which just added to making the night so special.

2023-07-31,3.0,"The food is food and I appreciate the nonstandard menu. I ordered the Go Fig or Go home mocktail, primarily because there was fig in it but I did not detect any fig flavor. It was still tasty though like a refreshing fizzy water, but not fig water. My recommendation to the restaurant when making this mocktail, however, is to please stir the drink before serving it or suggest the patron stir it. When I took my first couple sips, all I tasted was bland soda water. It wasn't until I stirred the drink several times when I finally tasted what I think it was supposed to taste like.

I had the Shawarma Spiced Grilled Fish of the Night which was swordfish. That was done very nicely since swordfish tends to be a bit of a dense fish. It wasn't dry at all and the rub they used was delicious. I don't like fish (only ordered it because I thought it'd be a healthy choice, but I liked this dish.  I also enjoyed the sweet potato that came with it. The sweet potatoes are a few thick round slices of sweet potato that were naturally sweet. I could have done without the beet tzatziki though. I think it was the color (pink like pepto bismol). It made sense that it was pink because tzatziki is white and beets are a dark red, but still, the color looked very unnatural. 

I can see why the Peasant Beef & Pork Bolognese is ordered often. It was quite good, and the portion size was just right.

The ambiance was a bit distracting. The restaurant  inside what looked like what used to be a hangar or warehouse, so when you look up, instead of seeing a ceiling, you see a curved metal roof. There is an open kitchen concept but perhaps a bit too open for me, as if the team was cooking feet away from you in the same room but not in a kitchen. The lighting could also be better. It was a bit too dim/dark, and the dark colored wood furnishings did not help.

I found the service distracting as well. Our server placed two small plates in front of us (presumably for our appetizers). Shortly thereafter, another server came up to ours and whispered to him with a disapproving facial expression and pointed to our table. This exchange occurred directly in front of me. The other server then removed those two plates without comment. I expected a ""pardon my reach"" or ""excuse me"" or ""I'm sorry, these plates were not supposed to be placed on your table."" Also, two different people brought our food to the table. Each person had a ""I'd much rather be somewhere else"" or ""this is such a chore"" expression on their faces.

Outdoor seating is available though it didn't look like there was much a view for outdoor dining ambiance. There's a busy street in front and orange construction barriers line the outside dining border.",357.0,Orzo

The bartender was great, and the drinks we had were decent. I ended up paying $100 for a meal that was extremely difficult to eat. I declined to discuss it with anyone that worked there as it was fairly busy, and the waitstaff were not exactly attentive to us (besides the bartender).

I also had the duck fat potatoes which were fine but not crispy the way duck fat cooked potatoes should be. What is the point of the duck fat if not done properly?!

Better impression: appetizers comes out within 5-10 mins after being ordered, in a packed-from-the-back-to-front of restaurant. Classic Minestrone Soup? Delicious. 18 Month Prosciutto di Parma Bruschetta? Freakin better than any bruschetta I've had in the past 2 years. 

Entrees were what stood out to me. 

Spaghetti pomodoro was just perfect. Balanced. Frequent hits of Basil touched the palate. Banger dish. 

Grilled Marinated Pork Tenderloin with whatever the hell dried cherry mostardo is (later I found out it's basically fruit and mustard), delicious. Oh and there's a hidden layer of smoked aioli. SMOKED AIOLI freakin smacked me in the face. The entire plate was cohesive af. 

Dessert. 
-Pot de creme: simple with two ingredients yet so so good. I'm going to attempt to recreate this at home.

peasant beef and pork bolognese: great pasta texture and even spread of meat, flavorful, definitely my favorite of the night

grilled fish: happened to be salmon, which was super tender. came with some tomato slices and potato, which was a great add on. really delicious, but wish there was a bit more fish for the cost

riviera: me and bf thought it was okay, not too strong. warning that once it dilutes it tastes like cucumber water though!

I ordered the spaghetti Bolognese and, honestly, I was disappointed with what I got for the price point. The sauce was nothing spectacular. My partner's salmon was undercooked.

The same restaurant that is too small to fit all of its guest so they open up the middle of the waiting room of Feast to sit their guests? Is this the same restaurant with only one working bathroom not situated inside of the restaurant? Is Orzo not the restaurant that offers chewy and utterly inedible steak? The only meal that fits right in is the Peasant Beef and Pork Bolognese, because I sure felt like a peasant eating here.

2024-06-26,3.0,"Meh. We were at another restaurant having drinks and decided to hoof it over here bc the pasta was supposed to be amazing... We will never know. Sat at the bar and ordered a glass of rosé, which was sensational btw, but when we first sat down the bartender was pretty short. We sat down and he said ""I'm not ready for you yet"" and walked away. It was really odd. I understand that you have a full bar and you're very busy but just communicate properly "" hey guys, welcome in, I'm working on a couple drinks right now, do you mind if I come back down to you in a minute?"" that's all that needed to be said not, ""I'm not ready for you.""

When he came back and I got the sensational glass of rosé, we were ready to put in our appetizer before deciding on our main entrée. We ordered the appetizer and then asked us what we'd like for our entrée, we said we're still debating the entrée and will order later, he said ok and walked away. Two minutes later he came back and asked ""are you ready to order your entrée"", and we replied ""no we're going to wait until we have our appetizer and then we'll put in our entrée."" He said "" I have to put it all in at once so I'm not gonna put your appetizer in until you order your entrée"". So strange since we were both sitting there waiting on the appetizer we thought we had put in ... If he hadn't informed us of this we would've been waiting a long time! I complained about it to the woman sitting next to me, who was listening to the entire transaction, just shrugged. This was the second ding she heard me mention about our short time there.

The bartender could send the dissatisfaction of having to order everything at once and then started to explain that it's because the kitchen gets backed up and when you put in your appetizer and entrée separately it kicks back to square one and it could take 45 minutes to come out. Again, if that has been communicated at the beginning of ordering, this wouldn't have been an issue. It's like when you go to a Spanish restaurant, and they tell you the paella will take 45 minutes to cook so that you have an expectation. Just communicate.

It gets weirder! Right after this interaction, while sitting at the bar, I started to draft my Yelp review.  I even pushed back a bit and held my phone at an angle so the bartender didn't see as to not be rude. As I'm in the middle of drafting my yelp review, the host looks over and says ""what are you writing? ""And I didn't know how to respond so I said ""my yelp review ... what are you writing"" and then in what seemed like a power-play, he said btw I'm the owner and have you met my wife... She's sitting right next to you. Apparently, I was sitting next to his wife and daughter at the bar the whole time and she was the one I mentioning the bartender was being rude and that I couldn't believe we had to put our whole order in at one time. 
In that moment, I was so taken aback by his comment on my yelp review and then making me feel so awkward with his ""power-play "". But in true fashion, I dug back in and told his wife ""I don't regret what I said / the bartender was curt and it's ridiculous to have to order everything at once, that's not what dining out is about and it doesn't make it enjoyable. Further had he just communicated properly then it would have been a perfectly pleasant experience"".

2024-11-25,3.0,The ambience is nice. The interior is well decorated. Unfortunately the food was woefully unappealing. There are so many great restaurants on main street that I have a hard time ever returning to Orzo. The good thing about Orzo is that it is easy to get a table...because it is not popular.,106.0,Orzo

2024-12-17,5.0,"This is one of those spots I've been wanting to try for a while now so I'm really happy that one of my friend's love and excitement for their Hummus at Orzo is why we came here.

Walking in on a Saturday evening, there were 3 of us without a reservation, but that didn't seem like an issue as we were seated almost immediately. The ambiance and aesthetics were nice!

We all ordered our own entree, but we started off with the hummus which came with some nice warm bread. It wasn't pita bread so I was surprised, but it tasted really good. My friend was right about the hummus, it was definitely a hit! I can see why he will just go to Orzo sometimes for the hummus only.

For my entree, I ordered the Saffron Risotto which can be tricky to make, but once again, a hit! Orzo really made it taste great and it was a perfect sized portion as well.

I did not try and of the drinks or the desert this time around, but I look forward to trying these on my next visit!",123.0,Orzo
2025-01-31,5.0,We went for Cville restaurant week and they were so accommodating! We didn't have a chance to make reservations and they were really kind about us inquiring about a place at the bar. The food was delicious and a great value for restaurant week. The options on the menu were varied and all looked delicious. I  would additionally give a special shout out to their incredible tiramisu. We hope to return!,7.0,Orzo

2025-02-05,5.0,"Fresh, delicious food you feel good about eating. We thoroughly enjoy the cozy atmosphere, friendly service, and wide selection of wines. They have a smaller cocktail menu, but equally as delicious. A great date night spot, but not pretentious - you can enjoy any time you like!",78.0,Orzo
