Rose C.,17/07/22,,,,5,"Delicious Aegean cuisine on West Main Street!
Interesting menu with perfect ingredients.....great ambiance and cordial staff.",12,
Chris B.,08/08/22,,,1,5,"Exceptional. Everything was absolutely delicious, and the service was so nice. The octopus perfectly charred, the lamb meatballs were incredible. And while you can get hummus all over the place, theirs is next level. Incredible Aegean food.",55,34
Nicko A.,18/08/22,,,1,5,"Great Mediterranean food , everything was  super tasty. The skewers  were the highlight as well as the dips. Friendliest service you can get. 
Definitely coming back",64,1
Bohdana S.,20/08/22,1,,1,5,"Charlottesville needed that place. The food is just outstanding, Mediterranean cuisine in different variations. You can find here everything you are craving for. Kabobs, seafood, ribeye, pasta, different appetizers. I definitely recommend to try octopus, calamari and rib eye steak. But honestly anything you will order you would not regret about. It's been my third time here and I just love it. Definitely my spot to go right now when I want to have a good food and great ambiance. The service is always so friendly and helpful. Music and atmosphere are so charming which is making you feel so relaxed. Great cocktails as well, Smyrna Sour is my forever favorite drink. Good job guys, you are making this city better and thank you for that!",4,
Jason S.,20/08/22,1,,,5,"What a great spot just opened on the Main street in Charlottesville. Was so excited to visit since my friends recommended me it as a new hot spot. The food is great, I tried the Octopus, which probably was the best I tried in town and Tagliatelle pasta that was absolutely delicious. Service is very professional and made sure we were satisfied with everything.Nice atmosphere and decor, everyone who is working there were so friendly and made us feel so welcomed. We enjoyed talking with owner who told us a little story how the Smyrna was born. Definitely will be our to go spot, it is so nice to have this kind of local places in town where people are so warm and treating you like a family.",7,
Vickie P.,07/09/22,,,,5,"Casual with a sophisticated menu best describes this restaurant. Food is artistically presented and in just the right portions that when you leave you are pleasantly full and not stuffed. All staff were professional, friendly, attentive but not overbearing. The owner visited the tables making sure every customer was satisfied and answered any questions. Highly recommend!

For appetizers we had the charred octopus which was tender and charred perfectly.  The tomato salad had a very thinly sliced and peeled tomato topped with peeled cherry tomatoes, strawberries, cheese, thin sliced sourdough crisps and greens with a pomegranate vinaigrette. The beef skewers melted in your mouth and are made with local beef.

We were excited to see manti dumplings on the menu knowing they are time consuming to make. The perfect choice for a vegetarian meal.

The burger, from local beef, was cooked perfectly as ordered and the aioli and sumac onions were a bonus. The tasty house fries were perfectly prepared served with homemade ketchup for dipping.

For dessert we chose the panna cotta and almond frangipane both of which the flavors were perfectly balanced.

The restaurant also has an extensive selection of alcohol as well as wines from all over. There is also a specialty drink menu.

We will be back!",6,
Helen P.,20/09/22,,,,5,"Great new Cville spot!  Warm, friendly atmosphere and staff.
Had the burger - lamb & beef!  Simply fabulous.  Great fries with it, too!
Wife had the Manti dish and we both kept stealing each other's food.
The NY trained chef is a real bonus - try any of his starters or specials!

Melody B.,01/10/22,,,1,5,"This place is amazing. The dining room is lovely, the service was friendly and knowledgeable, the cocktails were tasty, and the food was superb. With guidance from the server, our party of three started with the meze trio of charred eggplant, goat cheese dip, and hummus with grilled bread. Next up was the fried calamari,  lightly breaded and perfectly fried, and charred octopus. For our main dishes, we all three shared the lamb skewers, dumplings, and the (according to my husband) the best burger he has ever had. Very highly recommended. We will be back often!",25,2
Lina J.,06/10/22,,1,3,5,"The best steak we've had in Cville. Every dining experience here has been a delight. The first time we came we got a bunch of appetizers (including their renowned grilled octopus) and tried their different kebabs. Everything was delish! 

Most recently we ordered the rib-eye for 2. We were warned before that it takes the longest of any item on the menu to cook so expect a decent wait time (I think it was 40ish minutes) but it was WELL worth it. The steak was beautifully cooked. The sides complimented it perfectly. Our waiter showed us the steak before it was sliced for us - it just felt really nice to see how proud the restaurant was of their food and have it translate so well into an excellent tasting meal! The staff has always been incredible and welcoming every time we've visited. 

We also love their house made sparkling water. Such a Euro vibe lol! There is an extra fee to it (I think $2?) but it's added just a bit more sparkle to the dining experience. I also LOVE their stoneware, glasses, and cutlery. It's just a wonderful place to have a meal all around. It's definitely somewhere I'd bring my parents to in addition to being a great date night spot. We will definitely be back!",272,206
James N.,09/10/22,,,,5,"A great new addition to the Charlottesville dining scene! The service was some of the best we've ever had - Mark our waiter was very knowledgeable on all their dishes and wines and helped us pick out what was best.

Our favorites were the lamb skewers, the Manti Dumplings, and the Charred Octopus. All were fantastic. I'd pass on the fried paella though.",21,1
Finley O.,03/11/22,,,,5,"Smyrna has a warm, pleasant atmosphere and serves classic Turkish dishes that have been elevated in flavor and quality. The mezze trio was a fantastic start; each was delicious and the house bread is addictive. The calamari ticked all the boxes. The fisherman's gülaç was a great protein to split along with the manti dumplings. The chef excels at creating a wide variety of delicate, satisfying savory flavors. Will definitely go again and order more off the beaten path!",8,116
Alison W.,06/11/22,,,2,5,"Absolutely delicious! I only wish I could have enjoyed it dining in instead of takeout. The charred eggplant dip was particularly yummy of the three meze options, and all the kebabs and manti were so good. Smyrna would be great spot for a date night or nicer meal out because it's definitely a little more expensive than your usual Mediterranean option.",174,251
Caleigh E.,13/11/22,1,,,5,"Best restaurant in Charlottesville! From the service to the ambiance to the food, it can't be beat. The Mezze Trio is perfect for sharing among 2-4 and then a couple skewers and apps can even make a meal. Haven't tried an entree yet but looking forward to next time.",1,125
Jaimee T.,19/11/22,,,,5,"Amazing spot in Charlottesville, totally worthy of date night. Food was a delightful surprise, each dish better than the next. Highlights were the mezze trio, calamari and the lamb meatballs. Great cocktails and service. Excited to have another option for a nice dinner out!",26,1
Shirley K.,26/11/22,1,1,1,5,"Such a great experience! My husband and I are out-of-towners who were visiting relatives for Thanksgiving.  We stopped by for dinner on the Friday after. We absolutely loved this place. Delightful setting -- such a chill, hip, and relaxed atmosphere. Very simple yet highly tasteful decorations from the lights to the flatware. Our sever was truly wonderful; he was charming, kind, and highly attentive. 

We got the Octopus, the Meze Trio, and the chicken and lamb skewers. I cannot emphasize how fresh the ingredients tasted and how flavorful everything was. The meats were grilled to perfection. 

They also have a full bar with a creative cocktail selections and solid wine and beer choices. It looks like a great date night spot! But also a great place to dine with family and friends.",35,1
Ziv H.,02/12/22,,,1,4,"A newish Turkish restaurant in C'ville, to add to the higher end of the dollar spectrum; on it, Otto's and Sultan Kebab.

It is narrow menu, inhabiting the past Bella's/Mangione, dramatically redone but reserving its
special tin(?) ceiling.

The meze trio, a shared starter was most notable for its properly charred eggplant; it takes a proper flame to get that flavor, a broiler will not do.   Excellent bread, described to us as made onsite. Quite so.

Manti dumplings, special, but not quite as much so as suggested...?

The fish dish 'guvec' , was a fennel based filet atop shrimp.  The fish properly prepared, just so, and the shrimp good. Perhaps to mimic a fresh caught fish you'd be served at a waterside restaurant on the Bosphorus. 

A curious baklava cheescake 'stack', unique.

I will admit that I am definitely more partial to the giant cooked meat Turkish spreads you may have to travel abroad to eat ( and dream of thereafter ), or the infinite dishes at Develi, the kunefe at Sultan Kebab, an excellent adana, or a cold doganay salgam to drink... 

Smyrna is different from those, turkish, i suppose, but in a more translated version in the view of the chef, perhaps for charlottesville.  Try it to see how it fits for you.",230,12
M K.,08/01/23,1,,,5,"One of the best meals I've had in cville in a while. Incredible food and cocktails, cozy ambiance, and overall creativity. Not knowing tons about it, I was so pleasantly surprised. Truly delish. The dumplings, meze trio, and season of the witch cocktail were standouts.",82,2
Dave M.,09/01/23,,,,2,"Insane how expensive the food is...I had an $18 burger that was cooked medium, too charred...and the mushroom dumplings kinda felt like they were from Trader Joe's... good cocktails though",7,5
Jennifer A.,15/01/23,,,,5,"If you're looking for a date night spot- this is it. We had the grandparents in town to babysit, so my husband and I wanted to go somewhere that we wouldn't typically take kids. This was a great find!

We sat at the bar because we hadn't made reservations (bar seating is first come, first served but you can order from the full menu). They were clearly busy but no one seemed rushed or flustered.  Everyone who helped us from the host, to the bartender, to the people delivering the food was both friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely some of the better service we've had recently.

For drinks my husband had the Smyrna lager and I had the Negroni. Admittedly it was the first time Ive ever tried one, but it was delicious.

For starters we got the Mezeh trio, an order of the bread (which came with dipping oil) and the raki balik. I'm not usually a fan of eggplant but all 3 parts of the trio were fantastic. The Raki balik was also on point! My husband who does not usually like raw fish even thought it was good- which is saying a lot.

For our mains my husband had the burger and I had the manti dumplings, both of which were also amazing!  We've only lived in Charlottesville for about a year, but I'd say this is the best food we've had here so far. 
We'll definitely be back, and recommend to others!",4,
Lolita G.,23/01/23,,,,5,"Impeccable service, outstanding food. What more do you need to know. The seafood! The lamb! The bread! Everything we have ordered has been out of the world.",23,15
Allison M.,27/01/23,4,,4,5,"What a delightful addition to the Charlottesville food scene!! This would be a wonderful spot for a date night or just a refreshing change of pace from your typical night out. 

I came here with a small group which meant we got to try a bunch of different things. We started with the Meze trio- hummus, charred eggplant, goat cheese yogurt, as well as the house bread salca. All three dips were excellent along with the perfectly toasted bread. We also shared the octopus, Manti dumplings, and Fisherman's guvec. It seemed apparent there was careful attention to detail in all three dishes. The fish of the guvec was a table favorite. Lastly, we finished with a slice of Baklava cheesecake with marscapone cheese. This was my personal favorite. I don't need to say more because it was as delicious as it sounds. I never want to eat baklava or tiramisu on its own again after that. 

We loved our server- he was friendly and helpful without being overbearing or pushy. He was very patient and offered reasonable suggestions. 

Check this place out! Plus they have a great restaurant week menu coming up.",400,498
Graham G.,28/01/23,,,,5,Incredible food and drinks. Some of the best I've had in Charlottesville. Service was impeccable too. A little pricey but well worth it. Will be back for the next special occasion,18,359
Ryan K.,29/01/23,1,,1,5,"Tasty Turkish food. Smyrna has taken over a space that had been previously occupied by two other restaurants which went out of business. Smyrna is easily the best of the three. One wall features beautiful exposed brick and the bar which dominates the room. The lighting is dim, the music is played at a volume such that yhe vocals are indistinct, and there is the constant buzz of comfortable conversation. We split the Raki balik, charred octopus, yogurt-goat cheese dip, and Manti dumplings. The yogurt dip was delicious and the waitstaff offered to bring us more bread to attempt to finish it. The Raki balik had a unique flavor combination, but it worked well. The octopus was perfectly cooked and served with a delectable sauce. The dumplings were not what I expected, but it was a tasty dish nonetheless. Overall, I had a pleasant experience at Smyrna and would recommend them.",674,21
Katie L.,06/02/23,,,1,5,"Went to Smyrna for restaurant week and it was so good! The kabocha squash soup was fantastic, the stuffed squid was delicious and OMG the baklava cheesecake is probably the best dessert I've ever had, and I usually hate cheesecake! Our server Cory was so nice and attentive! Wonderful service and atmosphere!

Highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you are just passing through Charlottesville because you are unlikely to find such a unique and delicious Turkish restaurant elsewhere!",4,6
Hannah S.,19/02/23,,,,5,"Had a great experience at Smyrna. We sat at the bar because we did not have a reservation, and loved getting to chat with the bartender throughout the evening. Food was all insanely good - we started with the mezze trio and the grilled octopus, then shared the market salad, the lamb kebabs, and the manti dumplings. All so simple yet unique and flavorful. Cocktails were amazing too! Can't wait to be back - definitely in the top 3 meals we've had in Charlottesville.",4,
Christina B.,21/02/23,,,1,5,"Excellent food, Super service. Very pricey. Food was extremely creative and high quality. Cocktails were amazing - even a straight up Single Malt Scotch.",22,2
Angela G.,17/03/23,,,,5,"Phenomenal food attentive service. Everything was excellent. Bread and spread trios, calamari, salad, manti, dessert",8,
Sarah M.,19/03/23,,,,5,"Amazing!!!! We have been twice and each time, the food was phenomenal, and the vibes are perfect for date night.

Service was good!! Very attentive, kind waiter. Food took a bit long to come out, but worth it given how excellent each dish was! We ordered the mezze trio platter, the beet salad, the chicken skewers, the manti dumplings, and the chocolate hazelnut tart. 10/10.

Also the cocktails (and mocktails) are delish!! I always get the Smyrna sour which has pomegranate molasses and egg white. It's the perfect balance of tart and sweet, and so refreshing!",29,571
Justin N.,24/03/23,,,,5,"So so good! Super cute inside. Great casual yet sophisticated ambiance. On the pricy side but you get what you pay for quality-wise! The cocktails were so good-- some of my favorites in Charlottesville. The Turkish Coffee Martini is the best take on an espresso martini I've ever had. The Smyrna Sour was also delicious and had a nice foam, and both drinks were very pretty. The Meze trio was yummy. The charred octopus was also good. The Manti Dumplings were terrific too! The Pistachio Baklava Cheesecake was the cherry on top of a great dinner and drinks with friends.",372,109
Hannah H.,25/03/23,,,,5,Every dish was absolutely delicious. We ate something from each part of the menu and there wasn't a single thing we didn't enjoy. Thoughtful food and service. We can't wait to go back again soon.,5,
Melissa B.,09/05/23,1,,1,5,"Our waitress was amazing! She was knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful. We got the fried calamari which was delicious and perfectly cooked. You must get the meze trio so so good. I got the chicken skewers, the chicken was juicy and seasoned to perfection. I added the brussel sprouts which they also were cooked perfectly. You also HAVE to get the manti dumplings they are so so good. You just have to go. We had a group so we could all try everything which was a great idea!",308,118
Lori D.,12/05/23,1,1,1,5,"We decided to try Smyrna while in town for a long weekend, and we couldn't have been more pleased with the whole experience. We were greeted promptly by the friendly staff, we loved the atmosphere with the exposed brick walls, beautiful bar, and the minimal yet perfect decor. The server was very knowledgeable about the menus and very helpful with guiding us as we made our selections. The bartender was more like a cocktail crafter, as it seemed like he wasn't simply mixing drinks, but crafting a work of art - Very impressive and the drinks were not light on the alcohol. The food was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend a reservation, especially on the weekends. I hope to dine here again if I'm in the area.",86,13
Nicole D.,24/05/23,,,,5,"We went there on graduation weekend for the first time.  I could not be more sad that we did not discover this place sooner.  

The food was fabulous.  We the a spin on a gazpacho that was absolutely fabulous.  I had the chicken dish which qas one of the best chicken  I have had in a long time.  My son had the bucatini which was terrific. 

Lastly the desserts were just amazing.  I had the pana cotta which was to die for.  So delicious.  If I ever return to Charlottesville, we will be back here!",16,
Taylor W.,29/05/23,,,,5,"It was delicious and had unique food, great service, cool vibe. Would definitely return!",8,
Frank W.,11/06/23,,,,5,"Smyrna was suggested by some friends, and we were more than pleasantly surprised.

The service was outstanding from the hostess, our waiter, the bartender, and even the chef dropped by our table.  

We had their craft cocktails to start. After cocktails, we had the farmers bread, which is part sourdough and made with grain from a local mill. Next, it was the fried calamari (with a cucumber dill sauce) and charred octopus (with a reduction sauce that was off the chart!), both were amazing. 

For our mains, we had a chicken skewer and a burger. My wife loved the chicken skewer with a little slight heat that she really enjoyed. The burger was cooked perfectly, the fries were straight out of the fryer, and crispy.  

For our dessert, we had something that is not on the menu yet, but the chef said it may be coming soon. The dessert was strawberries, with meringue, Turkish cotton candy, and Meyer lemon granita. I have to say that It was the most amazing dessert I've ever eaten. 

It was by far one of, if not the best place we've eaten in, in Charlottesville. 

A culinary experience!",13,
Thomas B.,20/06/23,,,,5,"One of the better meals I've had in Cville in quite a while. Couldn't recommend it more highly!

Great service as well, very attentive staff.",4,251
Perry R.,22/06/23,,,,5,"This restaurant really deserves a 5 star rating. The food (mezze, meatballs and calamari) was delicious and the cheesecake was killer good. The service was friendly and attentive and we enjoyed the interaction very much. Highly recommended.",20,2
Julia W.,03/07/23,,,,5,"We had the charred eggplant, lamb kebab, and green salad. All were delicious and we would go back.",11,44
Reb N.,06/08/23,,,,5,"Wow! What a surprise! We had a nice variety octopus, oysters, rockfish and hummus trio. All were delicious! Service was fast and courteous. We will be back soon!",20,
Jeff S.,10/08/23,,,,5,Fantastic food and bar. Great service. Recommend. Really enjoyed it and will be back.,20,117
Esha R.,12/08/23,,,,5,"Oh my God, I was completely blown away by this place. I have tried a lot of different Mediterranean places and upscale restaurants, but this is by far one of my top three restaurants that I have ever tried. Not only was the service amazing, and the ambience super eclectic, but the food was out of this world.

We started by ordering what the waiter recommended, and it was great because he actually knew everything about the process and where the food came from which I really appreciate when I ask the waiter what they recommend. First was a variety of oysters from different parts of the country and then bread came with different Middle Eastern dips and that was absolutely phenomenal as well as a cold soup (fyi they do charge for each extra bread you order sadly). We started to order a bunch of entrées and each one had so many different flavors and textures that we finished everything on the plate. I was even very happy to see that their mocktails and non-alcoholic beverages were abundant, and when it came out, it was as pretty as my friends who got cocktails.

The desserts that we got were out of this world. There was one with a Turkish cotton candy style flavoring that melted in our mouth, which I don't think I will ever forget. The experience was amazing and the restaurant even let us sit late because it started storming outside. 

The only parking is on the street so you may have to walk a couple blocks based on how crowded it is in the area. I cannot wait to go back.",38,12
Russlyn S.,17/08/23,,,,5,Truly the best hummus I have ever tasted--and incredible homemade bread! To die for.,1,
Emily Y.,08/09/23,,,,5,"Wonderful meal at Smyrna tonight! Start to finish, a lovely experience. I can't think of a single flaw. Our host Martin was super attentive & took great care of us. Food & drink were superb - we ordered a bunch of stuff to share & I will just list them starting with my faves, but everything was great. The unique cotton candy dessert was such a perfect end to the meal:
Manti dumplings (amazing little mini dumplings), chicken kabob (delicious seasoning), seafood main (SO MUCH juicy seafood & dippable jus), calamari in fluffy tempura-like batter, lamb kabob, heirloom tomorrow salad, mezze...great crusty bread & we appreciated the complimentary gazpacho to kick things off. 
Thank you Smyrna! Highly recommend & we look forward to next time.",34,
Victoria B.,10/09/23,,,,5,"Best service, best food and best vibe. caring employees who are truly paying close attention to their customers. The bartender even came out from behind the bar to fill out water glasses. The food was over the top amazing!! we will be back for sure!!",4,
Sheila M.,25/09/23,,,1,1,"This place is all hype.  I brought my mother here on her birthday and it was so disappointing! The decor is swanky -- dim lights, cool music, nice bar.  So lots of mood points, but zero food points.  We ordered the charred octopus and the meze trio to start, followed by lamb skewers, manti dumplings and fisherman guvec. For drinks, we had the kusco poison. The meze trio was blah--hummus and tzatziki/labneh seemed sourced out of packets, the eggplant was smoky but otherwise unremarkable in flavor.  I baked better bread at home over the pandemic than what came with the dips.  The drink was mostly champaign with a hint of something yuzu/citrous, but just too subtle to be lively. The worst part was the 40 min. wait before the mains arrived.  The octopus was hard as a rubber hose.  We were starving so we ate it. The rest of the items were passable, but nothing that Public Oyster, Mas, Orzo, Tavola, Oakhart Social, Petit Pois, C&O, and even Maya two doors down can't serve equivalents of in a heartbeat.  The fish was the best item if I had to choose--it was perfectly cooked and the broth was complex. There is a rhythm to Aegean meze that involves generous quantities of tasty bites, some savory, some tart or sweet with delicate textures and light broths.  Accompanied by lightly charred fishes and meats and some fragrant drinks.  All doled out at a perfect pace.  This place didn't come close to that dance.  For the prices, Sultan Kebab (its sister restaurant) serves up fare that is actually worth what they charge.  The chef was very gracious.  Insisted on giving us a baklava cheesecake to make up for the disastrous octopus and the endless wait, but that cloying block of honey drenched pastry didn't make up for the lackluster experience.  I grew up on Mediterranean food in that part of the world and this is nothing like it.  Cville has too many good restaurants for this to be as buzzy as it is.",25,46
Mae O.,29/09/23,,,,5,"Excellent food, especially the fish stew! Our server was great and service was very friendly! One of our best meals this summer.",17,64
Lauren G.,21/10/23,,,,5,Wonderful service and food. My favorite was the hummus as well as the beef skewers. The staff is so friendly and warm.,4,
Alex G.,29/10/23,,,,5,"We had such a phenomenal meal here. We got the mezze trio, beet salad, crudo, fries, chicken skewer, and lamb meatball skewer. Everything was fantastic. 

Shockingly, the beets -- wide ribbons marinaded and sprinkled with crushed hazelnuts -- were the don't miss item (and a comp for some reason? Thanks!). 

Service was great -- attentive without being intrusive.

Sal C.,13/11/23,,,,5,"Great Mediterranean/Turkish restaurant. Excellent service, well-paced without the rush. So hard to decide what to order. Started with meze trio; charred eggplant, hummus and yogurt-goat cheese dips with plenty of warm bread. Followed with curried pumpkin soup. Warm spices were perfect for a chilly night. Mains were chicken skewers and fishermen's stew. Chicken was tender and moist. Stew was perfect with shellfish and rockfish in a light and flavorful saffron broth. If you're in Charlottesville, you must try this exceptional restaurant.",4,
Kayla R.,13/11/23,,,,5,"Amazing! Literally everything we ordered was so delicious! Butternut soup, beet salad (best I've ever had)  Dip trio, dumplings (my favorite dish) and all 3 skewers PLUS baklava cheesecake., literally heaven! so clean, cute, great service and yummy!",2,
Jessica G.,01/12/23,,,,5,"An absolute dream.

Having a perfect dish is a fine balance of decadence and acid - leading you to the next bite. Everything I had delivered on that.

The wine and cocktail menu is absolutely fantastic. I found myself reading over and over the menu and really thought it hit every single mark, surely any person you be here will be incredibly happy.

I will find myself dreaming of the Manti Dumplings and Smyrna Sour for weeks, months, and maybe even years to come. Hell, I'd drive to Charlottesville from DC just for a second round.

Kudos, Chef. Keep the dream alive. Cheers to you.",152,18
Elizabeth M.,24/12/23,,,,5,Great place to bring friends and family visiting town. Good vibes and delicious food. I particularly like the lamb skewers and the manti dumplings.,8,
Mark E.,31/12/23,,,,5,"Orhun and his staff create a fabulous dining experience. The ambiance is warm and welcoming. The servers are attentive. We've eaten at this restaurant 3 times and the food has been consistently excellent. Tarik, the executive chef, has created an eclectic and unique menu that's both unique and enticing. Everything we've tried has been delicious. I can't recommend it enough.",21,2
Doug L.,26/01/24,,,,5,"We knew the food would be a little out of the ordinary, Smyrna being a Turkish / Mediterranean restaurant, but we weren't expecting stellar, outstanding, never-before dishes. The custom cocktails were interesting and delicious, the curried squash soup was just a little spicy and a brand new combination of flavors and textures. The chicken ""skewers"" were flavorful, tasty medallions of roast chicken with a red (paprika?) sauce that added another layer to the experience. Manti dumplings were tiny and plentiful and well-paired with a sour (yogurt?) sauce. Staying away from the dessert menu was impossible as we'd never heard of ""baklava cheesecake"" before and the fortified dessert wines included decent tawny port AND vinsanto. Absolutely delightful staff, carefully-restrained elegant atmosphere, and nowhere near as noisy as other nearby establishments. Highly recommended!",103,20
Sonia D.,18/02/24,,,,5,"We really enjoyed our dinner tonight at Smyrna. The food was delicious, our server extremely attentive and helpful, and the ambiance was lively but with the ability to carry on a conversation. Our party ordered many of the well loved items mentioned in previous reviews including the  trio of dips, squash soup, and manti dumplings-it's easy to see why they are popular! We also got the fish stew and vegetable mains. Highly recommend for a tasty meal with great service and atmosphere",6,
Laura J.,19/02/24,,,,5,"We had dinner here last night for my 35th birthday. It was the right choice!! We started with the de la Manhattan and the Turkish coffee martini (my husband's order - it was delicious but I would have saved it for dessert!) 
Apps were the meze trio - we loved all three but my favorite was the hummus. Then we got a sample of the butternut squash soup from the kitchen - so good! Gently spicy and the pepitas were a nice contrast. 
For our main we split the doner kebab, lamb kebab, and the dumplings. Everything was delicious but the doner was an absolute standout. 
We were sent home with the baklava cheesecake and it was INCREDIBLE. I will be back just for the cheesecake. 

The ambience was cozy, the service was attentive and friendly. Thank you so much Smyrna for an epic celebration!!",3,86
Robert L.,26/02/24,,,,5,"Food and service were both excellent. This is a rare gem, even for the 'foodie' establishment of Charlottesville. If he were able, Thomas Jefferson would likely be knocking on the door.

Pro tip: make a reservation.  This is a relatively small restaurant and it fills up quickly.",53,3
Elizabeth E.,27/02/24,,,,5,"It's tapas so you know what you're getting yourself into in terms of bang for buck.

All of the beverages our table ordered were great. Kuzcos poison was the favorite of the two I ordered with blue lambas being the other. My husband and our friend got the Smyrna sour and they both loved them. Our other friend got the Turkish coffee martini and she said it was delicious. 

We got the olives, the mezze trio and the beet salad. The olives and all the dips were phenomenal. Both the regular bread and the gluten free bread were delicious. The beet salad, however, was bad. I would not order it ever again anywhere. 

My husband and I split the three skewers. All of them were delicious. That was some of the most moist chicken I've ever had anywhere. The beef was good, nothing special. The lamb meatballs were really yummy. 

Overall I'm a big fan and I'd go back. Since everything was practically perfect (excepting the salad), I think 5 stars is fair but 4.5 would be more accurate",141,167
Kelly K.,24/03/24,,,,5,"We really enjoyed our meal at Smyrna. We started with a meze trio and then I had the Vegetable Turlu and my husband had the Fisherman Guvec!  Everything was very, very favorable! Great portions too! And the service was amazing!  Check Smyrna out!",15,120
Ry L.,31/03/24,3,1,3,5,"I'm still in awe of this restaurant. Tonight, I finally tried the Manti Dumplings, one of their most popular dishes, probably their staple. I was always hesitant because I don't like mushrooms. This is perhaps one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. Again, I don't even like mushrooms. 

Also, tried the chicken skewers for the first time. I was a bit disappointed because their menu can change seasonally, and I was banking on trying the beef skewers but they're no longer on the menu. (Lamb is still an option, though.) However, the chicken didn't let me down. They have an impressive char flavor and are juicy and flavorful. Even the garnish and sauce were incredible. 

I've yet to try anything here that didn't impress me. By far my favorite restaurant in Charlottesville.",196,68
Emma S.,11/05/24,,,,4,Ambiance was great! Best part was the dip trio! I thought it was a little pricey for the portion sizes,3,
Angela B.,14/05/24,,,,5,"I had a lovely evening here! The food was lovely and was so comforting. The interior is cozy, but still spaced out enough that you're not distracted by other table's conversations. 
I think my favorite thing I tasted was a toss up between the smoked eggplant dip and the Smokey Mountain cocktail. Both just had such amazing depth. Honorable mention to that hummus. I have to find a way to recreate that flavor!

My only thought in improvement was very minor, and I feel like I'm splitting hairs with this one. The gazpacho, although delicious, I wished packed a bit more of that tart/sour cherry flavor advertised on the menu. The cherries in the dish were far sweeter than I expected, but it was such a tiny detail. 

I would recommend this place for anyone looking to see how flavorful vegetarian food can be. These folks did great!",8,
Natalie H.,14/05/24,,,,5,This place is truly worth 5 stars. The food was divine and presented beautifully. Presentation was really out of this world. The drinks were unique and delicious. Service was excellent and thoughtful. The whole place was amazing!! Truly worth the 5 stars. If you haven't been you must go!!,2,
Andrew S.,11/06/24,5,1,7,5,"What a fantastic find. I was recently here for dinner and loved everything we ordered. We started with the bread, beet salad, and calamari. Beet salad was super tasty and it made me wonder how they managed to shred the beets like that. Interesting way to serve it. Fried Calamari was crispy, fresh and went well with the sauce. My main was the Lamb Burger, which comes with fries. Burger and fries were perfection. I love when the fries are super thin and crispy. Highly recommend all of these dishes. 
 
Service was fast and friendly. The server did a great job coming back to check on us and fill our waters. Street parking in the area, with more parking available in nearby lots. Can't wait to come back.",1268,4808
Tricia W.,09/07/24,,,,5,"I had read good things about Smyrna and was curious to try it. Every dish was done uniquely and deliciously. My table shared a bunch of dishes, small and large and we were impressed with every one of them. The waitstaff and busser were very attentive and friendly. Harun was our server and was very helpful. Would recommend to anyone 10/10.",108,151
Charles C.,11/07/24,,,,5,"This was an incredible meal from beginning to end. The staff are so friendly and helpful without being pushy. They have creative and delicious cocktails. I got a Smokey Mountain which had smokey whiskey, amaro, and rosemary among other things. Delightful. We ended up sharing a goat cheese appetizer with perfect bread, lamb meatballs served with a dill yogurt sauce and incredible dumplings called manti. I had never had them before and would definitely get again. I love that the portions are perfectly sized. We didn't have leftovers and we didn't over eat too much. Dessert was a baklava cheesecake. Wow! One of the best meals I've had in a while.",38,213
Rodin Z.,22/07/24,,,,5,"Fantastic!!! Authentic!
Turkish delight to the max. We had the best experience!
Our server was so sweet, genuinely interested in making our visit pleasant, very attentive.
Exquisite flavors!!! We absolutely loved every dish and savored every bite!
If we lived in this city, it would be our regular spot. Highly recommend!",8,
Kim V.,24/07/24,,,,5,"One of my top two places to eat in CVille so far. Great food, service, and cocktails in a ""just right"" environment.",20,15
Kate S.,03/08/24,,,,5,"We had a blast here! The server (a guy with glasses - can't remember his name ) totally matched our vibes and even engaged in a game of ""what vegetable could you eat the most of"" with us. Each dish packed a punch of flavor, nuance, and aesthetically pleasing - trust us, we tried a lot! Besides the obvious (dip trio, dumplings) the octopus is a MUST try. Mocktails and beverages all delivered. We were sat promptly at our reservation time. A gem!",117,
Mark M.,18/08/24,,,,5,Absolutely fantastic! The service from hostess to wait staff was top notch and the food was absolutely amazing.  We'll be back every time we visit the area.,10,
Alec B.,07/09/24,,,,5,Wow. Everything we tried was beyond fantastic! Great service as well. Awards in their future.,2,
Payton W.,09/09/24,,,,5,"Wonderful experience. The service was fantastic and the food was even better! We shared the charred eggplant and each tried the manti dumplings and both were incredible. They also have a great cocktail list-- I was having trouble deciding what to try but went with the gimlet, which was excellent. Perfect spot for a special occasion!",49,
Traci W.,09/09/24,,,,5,"We've been here a few times, and I've loved all of the dishes I've had so far. For our first time here, our server was so helpful in guiding us on what to choose (for both food and mixed drinks). As a vegetarian, my favorite dishes are the manti dumplings and beet salad. The vegetable turlu is also delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu.

And definitely have a mixed drink or two. They are yummy.",20,26
Brandon B.,18/09/24,1,,,5,"One of the best meals in Charlottesville. From the bread to the seafood, the dumplings to the burger, everything is so incredibly good. Then add a great bar program and honestly, I can't wait to come back. This is a must eat place.",220,10
Neelam P.,30/10/24,1,,1,4,"Delicious food, a bit expensive.  Enjoyed the manti dish very much, it was a savory dish and the dumplings were well made.  Meze trio dips were also good (hummus, eggplant, and yogurt dips).  Shishito peppers were awesome.  

We didn't enjoy the dessert (lemon granita) though, would pass on that next time.",1104,155
Adam T.,24/11/24,,,,3,"We were very excited to try this restaurant for the first time given the reviews.

My wife enjoyed her wine, while my Sazarac was good.

I had the manti which was a small dish for a main. The dumplings were tiny and there weren't many of them. The flavor was very good.

My wife had the halibut. It was a very small piece of fish and it tasted quite fishy. The bed of orzo was good, not great.

We enjoyed the fries and brussels sprouts.

The bread was the standout item in my opinion.

Service was friendly and timely.

The space was casual. Our table was close to the entrance and chilly.

Overall, the restaurant was a letdown for us, given the hype.",12,
Margaret G.,10/12/24,,,,5,Excellent food. Good service despite crowded Restaurant. Hard to book a table! Hope to eat there again.,7,
Elizabeth A.,11/01/25,,,,5,"Amazing blend of food and eclectic flavors . Fusion and beautiful display of food. Good portions . Pleasant and attentive staff. Squash soup was very curry flavored, calamari was to die for tender and just the right crust, many dumplings melted in your mouth .",47,
