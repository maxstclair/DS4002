1,,Eric C.,29/12/08,,2,2,4,"This is an excellent restaurant right on main street in downtown Charlottesville.  The food was excellent and very well priced given the high quality of food you received.  After seeing how delicious the dinners of those around me looked, I went out on a limb and ordered a dish with spinach (I normally despise it) and I ended up polishing it off.

I went in the winter time so it was a bit cramped inside.  I can definitely see the potential for it in the warmer months though.

-1 star for the fact that our waitress broke the cork while opening our bottle of wine.  I know she was trying hard, but she still assured us that it was okay only to pour a glass, have cork in it, and not even notice.  To not be a jerk, I only asked for a replacement first glass, which she agreed to, but the one that she brought was clearly less full than the original one poured.

Note:  Though the restaurant name means peas...  I inquired and there seemed to be no secret pea recipe they had, so I didn't bother to try them.  My friend did and she thought they were good (but not mind blowing)

Overall I definitely will make a return trip if I'm in the mood for great french food next time I'm in Charlottesville!",62,8,view review
2,,Jessica M.,28/07/09,1,,1,4,"Ate outside at Petit Pois beside Senator Warner and Professor Larry Sabato (you know its gotta be good if the politico big wigs in Cville hit it up) and had a great meal. The cheese plate was great and the bread was fantastic - crusty on the outside, moist and rich on the inside.
I got the risotto with asparagus and roasted tomatoes and it was pretty good, although I think it could use some more flavor.
I'll definitely be there again and I've heard the mac and cheese is great (it wasnt on the menu the night I went)",53,381,view review
3,,John M.,23/05/10,,,1,3,"Visited this restaurant while we were walking around downtown - wanted a small bite before dinner and heard good things from the owners of the B&B where we were staying.

Decided to get the snail appetizer - ever since we had them for the first time in Chicago at Le Creperie we've been into it, and figured we'd try theirs.  I had a beer as it was warm out and we weren't feeling the wine (French heavy list with some local stuff, etc.).  The server was very friendly and helpful, but the Escargot was only OK.  Both places we've been to in Chicago had better, and honestly I expected a bit more from the place.

Great outdoor seating, although during a windy day beware the falling branches, etc....",273,68,view review
4,,Tomu F.,26/07/10,,,1,3,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday.

We started with the mussels appetizer. Nothing really special to it, but I liked it. Some of the mussels tasted a bit raw, but I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to taste or if it was undercooked. The white wine broth went well with the bread that they served us.

My girlfriend had the tuna entree, which was pretty bland, and honestly, not great at all. It was basically seared tuna on top of a salad with vinegar dressing. Portion was very small as well. I had the veal entree. The portion was small, again, but the meat was soft and went well with the creamy potatoes.

I would give them 2-stars, but service was good and I liked the outside seating right beside the fountain. hence 3-stars.",4,72,view review
5,,Joe B.,17/09/10,,,,4,"Had a lovely Labor Day lunch here. It has a great ambiance and really friendly waitstaff.

Everyone was very happy with their meal I loved my Seared Hanger Steak with shallots, fries, and herb butter.",15,87,view review
6,,Jelena W.,04/07/11,1,,2,5,"Open for lunch on the 4th of July, serving Polyface Farms chicken, and an incredible chocolate mousse to split with my notoriously chocoholic auntie... what could be better? 

We were three for lunch, all fairly picky after having a delicious dinner at a wedding the previous night, and all three sampled each entree ordered and declared them universally delicious. Red wine chicken, onion tart, and (mine) tuna nicoise over mixed greens, followed by a honey tart and chocolate mousse for dessert... not a clunker in the meal.

I usually don't give five star reviews just on principle, but honestly the food couldn't have been better. Waitservice was a touch slow, but excusably so on a holiday. And as we left, the chef happened to be coming back inside from a stroll and stopped to tell us about their ingredients. If I'm ever back to Charlottesville I'll eat here again.",307,353,view review
7,,Holly G.,16/04/12,,,,4,"It was a beautiful day in historic downtown Charlottesville so we decided to sit outside for lunch.  Large trees all around make for a pleasant atmosphere.  (We took a peek inside the restaurant and were not impressed.)  

The beer and wine list is very short but adequate for lunch.  I had the pinot noir while my husband decided to experiment with beers - first with a chocolate milk flavored one then one with a more regular milk flavor.  I'm not a beer person but he says the second one was better.

We both started with the French onion soup.  It was okay but for the price I  (around $9) was expecting something a little more flavorful.  Also, it definitely could have been hotter.  

For the main course, my husband ordered the crab cake and I ordered the beet risotto.  Both were tasty but we both preferred the risotto.

We were too stuffed to even think about dessert.

All in all, a nice dining experience.",75,,view review
8,,Jennifer C.,17/06/12,,,,4,"The food was very good. We ordered Thr snails, which came with about 7 of them. Good sauce. Not enough sauce to dip with. Asparagus with prosciutto was smokey. Not my favorite. French onion soup was cheesy and delicious. Crabcake had a lot of crab. Recommend the Provenal stew, especially good with their perfectly crusty bread.",174,138,view review
9,,Richard S.,11/01/13,,,,4,"Surprised I didn't know about this place, but I have to say I was again surprised. My rating is probably closer to a 3.5, but I'll be nice and round up.

The food was simple and clean, which was good. The only caveat is that I thought it was kinda pricey for what I was getting; fortunately I'd probably still come here again.",79,26,view review
10,,Julia R.,31/03/13,,,2,5,"Fleurie's little sibling! We love Fleurie but only go for birthdays as it is over our budget otherwise. We just adore Petit Pois. I've had brunch here - which was delicious. I've also been here half a dozen times or more for dinner with friends or family. Everyone has always loved it, even if it is a tad on the expensive side. You get what you pay for!!!

I think we've tried everything on the menu. My boyfriend adores the roast chicken, we're both big fans of the hanger steak and fries and French onion soup, and I love the crab cakes. The chocolate mousse is delicious too! 

Truly everything we've ever had has been top-notch. Highly recommended for a fun date night or a more upscale night out with friends. You won't regret it!",43,16,view review
11,,Carla L.,10/04/13,,,,5,"Every time I'm in town, this is a must stop for me. I always start with an appetizer of steak tartare when I order  but I have yet to see it on the menu. As usual, it was superb. For my daughters main coarse, she ordered the risotto with mushrooms, while I ordered the Beef with root veggies. Knowing how much I love this area to come for a few days stay, I will definitely be coming back here. If something you love isn't on the menu doesn't mean they don't have it, ask the wait staff if they have it, they may just surprise you by saying yes.",300,168,view review
12,,Taylor M.,27/05/13,,,2,3,"I feel like Charlottesville thinks very highly of their food, and this place came strongly recommended. I found it pretty forgettable, though. I had the gnocchi, which was a small portion, and was far from the best I tried while visiting Virginia (Founding Farmers' gnocchi in DC was amazing!). 

The service was good and attentive, and the outdoor seating area is nice on these gorgeous spring days.... but the food was nothing super special and in my opinion, not worth the price.",257,59,view review
13,,Deborah H.,10/08/13,,,1,4,"This is a good place for solid service and variety of lovely dishes.  We had cold pea soup-perfect  for a very warm evening also roasted asparagus which was so good.  Desserts were fine too. 

This is comparable to nice bistro in ny by the way.

One thing is air conditioning was not working in the indoor space so eat outside.",840,105,view review
14,,Michael C.,11/02/14,,,2,4,"I had a pleasant experience at this cozy restaurant; by the end, I was regretting that I hadn't tried this place sooner. Petit Pois serves classic French bistro food and does it well.

With my friend, I tried two appetizers, two entrŽes, and a dessert.

To start, we had escargot and onion soup. The escargot was rich and garlicky from the standard herb butter treatment, but I found that the relative balance of butter versus herb and garlic was slightly off and would have liked to see more of the latter two. The onion soup was somewhat lighter than expected as it didn't have a rich flavor of beef stock as one typically hopes for, but they were really able to coax out a deep onion flavor that made up for it.

To continue, we had the beef short rib and the duck confit. Both came in generous portions. The beef short rib was enjoyable, and the crunchy potato was excellent--soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The only criticism I can muster is that the roasted carrots were a bit too sweet and the meat, while not dry, could have been slightly moister. The duck confit was a bit drier but still worked pretty well with the tart accompanying sauce.

To finish, we had the crme caramel (i.e. flan). The citrus and clove sauce was an excellent accompaniment and was well suited to the cold winter day on which we dined.",76,6,view review
15,,Michelle P.,24/02/14,2,,3,4,"My friend and I decided it was high time for a change of pace for dinner and decided we should go a bit upscale.  We settled on Petit  Pois, and I'm glad we did!  

We had a delicious round of appetizers including French Onion Soup and Mussels which were both outstanding.  Afterwards I begrudgingly picked out the steak frites - now, I love steak frites, but they're so often disappointing at places nowadays that I feel like it's a big gamble to order them.  Thank goodness Petit Pois proved me wrong.  I'm not exaggerating even a little when I say it was absolutely the best steak frites I have ever had.  The frites were crispy, full of herbs and flavor, and the steak perfectly done with a deliciously seared crust.  Could not have asked for better.  Went great with a local Lovingston white wine which I really enjoyed.

This place is minuscule inside so make sure you plan accordingly.  Also, the entire place is in the draft zone of the door, which is incredibly annoying. They really should put a curtain or something in place to mitigate the horrible icy breeze that sweeps through the place every time someone enters or exits.  As someone who is chronically cold, that really soured the ambiance.",149,33,view review
16,,Lena M.,04/03/14,,,5,1,"My fiancŽ and I were SO disappointed in this place. From their menu online it appears to be a small and cozy restaurant with delicious French food. 

We were not expecting margarine with stale bread, or tasteless escargots plopped in tepid sauce. My fiancŽ had the duck and I had a pork and beef pasta. The duck was a little dry but otherwise ok. There was too much pasta in my dish, and not enough meat. 

Will not be going back.",10,1,view review
17,,IS Palette S.,29/06/14,1,,2,4,"A sweet memory in Charlottesville's historic downtown open mall:

18,,Cody Y.,11/08/14,1,1,1,4,"This is a review solely for the drinks at the bar - which were actually pretty great. 

While waiting to get into another restaurant, my group of friends stopped at the very small bar inside. This place is upscale and chic with a very modern design of nice, clean lines and they were growing some grass on the bar (okay that sounds strange but it matches the modern decor). The inside bar was very small and seats only about six.

I ordered the mixed drink of the month, which consisted mostly of lemon and gin (Lemon Thyme?). It was fantastic - a great excuse to drink gin in the summer. The bar has a good selection of beer (mostly local VA beers such as Devil's Backbone and Blue Mountain Brewery), other mixed drinks, and a great wine list. We also ordered the Stinson Vineyards RosŽ, which I highly recommend.

I haven't had the food (yet), but at least the bar was awesome, and you can easily take up the whole thing with a group of friends. The prices are to be expected for the Charlottesville area, and the service was satisfactory.",733,152,view review
19,,Brendan W.,12/03/15,,,3,2,"Would normally give 5 stars, because food and service are usually impeccable, even when ordering food to take back to my office for lunch. Today unfortunately, I got an underseasoned and cold shrimp dish with overcooked frites. None of the usual charming touches: condiments, little box of bread and butter, or even the usual friendliness from inside the restaurant.

I am paying full-service price, leaving a full-service tip, and doing a favor for the restaurant's bottom dollar by leaving a table open in a small space. I wouldn't expect this really unusual service..",13,,view review
20,,Axel R.,26/06/15,,,,3,"Pretty excited about steak tartare... Don't go there for it. Poorly put together and way under seasoned. 
Also got a small salad which was okay. Waiter could not be bothered to put together cocktails for us so we had sparkling water. My wife did like her onion soup which earned this place the third star rather than just getting 2. 
I would not recommend going there unless you really are looking to get average food at a slightly higher than average price.",23,15,view review
21,,Erica S.,09/09/15,2,,1,5,"My husband and I were coming through town while on a road trip and just wanted a really good meal out at a nice place. We got it and then some!  The drinks and food were delicious, and the meal was made even more perfect by our fantastic server, Joellen. She was so passionate and energetic and informative about everything on the menu - and so warm -- she really made our meal.

We started out with drinks - with Joellen introducing us to a kind of wine made for several thousand years in the country of Georgia. I wasn't sure if it was what I wanted with my meal, so Joellen brought a bit for me and my husband to try.  It was lovely and interesting but not what I wanted with my dinner. But...I wasn't sure what I wanted, so after I selected my meal (with some help from her -- providing details on various dishes), Joellen offered to provide a selection of suitable pairings. She brought two white wines which she also was knowledgeable about. I tasted them both and instantly selected one to go with my fish.

We  had the chicken liver pate appetizer - the chicken is from a local farm, as are many of their ingredients. It was a mix of amazing flavors and spices and came with these perfectly buttery, toasted bread crisps. The combination was amazing.

Then my husband had the lamb meatballs and  I had the trout almondine. We both loved our dishes. The combination of flavors and elements...just lovely.

We ate outside, overlooking the fountain in the center of the pedestrian ""mall"" in Charlottesville, watching all the people enjoying the warm evening.

With all the great food in this great little city, it seems we could not have gone wrong eating out anywhere here, but we sure are happy we found this french bistro - charming and incredibly knowledgeable staff, lovely setting, delicious and thoughtful food.",27,1,view review

Went back the next day for lunch and had a frittata. If you go back the next day then you know it's good.",5,17,view review
24,,Tri L.,09/02/16,,,2,4,"Small space, moderately pricey, approachable french food, and good service.  Overall an enjoyable place to dine.

They have wine bottles on their menu in the $20-range which is a nice surprise.  Menu changes occasionally, though the steak-frites are a standard and are quite delicious.  Steak is cooked well and surprisingly tender while the fries are just awesome.  Like, eat the whole plate and order another side awesome.  Sure you'll feel terrible after doing this but whatever.

The other food has been hit or miss, lamb meatballs were pretty good, some chicken dish was also pretty good.  Some of the sides that come with the main dishes are underwhelming.

Steak-frites gets 5 stars.  Everything else in the 3-4 star range, including the service which was fine but not exceptional.  Bonus points for cheap bottles of wine.  Outdoor seating is great in nice weather, but the service slows down as these tables effectively double the size of the restaurant.",117,6,view review
25,,Kelly T.,12/03/16,1,,,5,"Let me tell you about the simply amazing meal at petit pois. My husband, mother-in-law and I sat on the patio. We got an amazing deal- bringing a bottle of virginia wine- the corking fee is only 10$ according to the website. (And if you're like us once you pop you just don't stop.) Anyhow! the patio was lovely that Thursday evening. You couldn't pick from the menu everything looked so good. My husband's beef was so good- my duck was awesome- I love the sauces are unique and delicious. I've had everything on the menu and everything makes you wish you could eat there every weekend.

This review is really service- Joella was charming. We felt really well taken care off. Petit Pois is really the best of both worlds- delicious food, great service in a bistro atmosphere you don't have to put on uncomfortable clothes for.",47,237,view review
26,,Yasuyo T.,27/03/16,1,,1,4,It is a small restaurant at downtown Charlottesville. The service was great. The portion was pretty good. I had trout. It was nicely seasoned and cooked. I would say that nothing was special but it was not bad for the price.,427,19,view review
27,,Tiffany N.,02/06/16,,,,4,"The food was absolutely delicious! Great wine selection too! The meal lived up to our high expectations for our anniversary.

I wish we could have sat outdoors, but it was a rainy night. The indoor ambiance was a little lacking. I didn't realize it was aiming for a bistro feel...I was expecting a little more upscale interior. It was also pretty dead on a Tuesday evening. It might be more lively on a weekend.",95,4,view review
28,,Kasey L.,19/06/16,1,1,4,3,"We were pretty charmed by Petit Pois' outdoor seating on a breezy Saturday evening in June. Four of us were easily able to get a table around 8:00. The restaurant gives off a healthy, fresh vibe with all the pea and wheatgrass decorations. 

The service was pretty mediocre. The hostess spilled water all over my leg/foot while trying to accomplish a cool pouring maneuver. Our waiter was nice and very efficient, but he wasn't super conversational or warm. The food was really just OK, too. The bread and butter before the meal was super generic. I ordered a steak (which our waiter recommended as ""the best steak in Charlottesville""), and it was so-so. It was cooked as I requested, but the quality of the meat wasn't what I was expecting. It did have a nice herby sauce! It was served with half a plate of shoestring fries which were tasty. I wish there had been some homemade ketchup instead of a commercial brand. I tried my husband's risotto, and it was bland and definitely undercooked. It had a ton of gorgeous fresh vegetables, but it desperately needed more flavor. Our two dining companions felt equally ""meh"" about their entrees. For the two of us, it was close to $60, so we didn't feel like it was worth it (maybe more of a 2.5 star experience). I'm not sure if I'll go back in the future.",377,137,view review
29,,Ryan L.,20/06/16,1,,,2,"My wife just rated this with a generous 3, but I'll review it myself without reading hers because I don't think this restaurant was A-Okay.

The positives:
-At 8 on a Saturday there was plenty of space on their outdoor patio. We didn't have to wait at all.
-Plenty of good people watching from our seats.

The negatives (from myself and the other two visitors who are not my wife):
-Undercooked risotto. It was crunchy. The chef could have figured this out if he'd tried it, then added a little more liquid and let it cook a bit longer. (the vegetables were good and fresh though)
-The trout was bland and under seasoned
-The lamb meatballs were thrown on a plate with several other seemingly random components
-The service was lackluster (poured a lot of water on my wife while missing a glass, water glasses sat unfilled regularly, the waiter repeated our decisions right after we ordered and had 2/4 incorrect, and had to come back to make sure he had the orders right (a second time))

I might come back and give it a second try after I've spent some more time in Charlottesville and exhausted a lot of the other options. If you are only passing through I wouldn't waste a meal here though.",212,75,view review
30,,Jack K.,11/02/17,,,,5,"Wow, what a great experience! One of the best meals I've had in a while in a small place right on the downtown mall.

My split pea soup appetizer was very nice, and substantial as well--almost a meal itself. I followed that with one of the better burgers I've eaten in a while--the beef was obviously fresh and high quality.  My daughter enjoyed her coq au vin; she's picky, and the fact that she ate every bite tells me all I need to know.

Petit Pois is a great place for business meetings because the wait staff is so professional. Our waiter was always around when we needed him, but never interrupted our conversation.  He knew the menu as well, and we appreciated his professionalism.",596,,view review
31,,Ashley V.,07/03/17,,,,5,"I came in for restaurant week and felt like their options were pretty good. I had no idea how small the place was (like VERY SMALL). My friend and I sat at the bar which wasn't too bad but definitely wouldn't have worked out if I had come with a larger party. I tried their lobster bisque which was very delicious but a bit heavy in the salt. I also tried their chicken with mashed potatoes which was reallly good and the chicken was very well cooked and juicy on the inside. I also had some dessert but I forgot what I got.... but I remember it being very mediocre. Overall, I loved the restaurant. They had the best service despite the chaos of restaurant week and the limited space they had to maneuver around the place.",196,433,view review
32,,Josh P.,06/05/17,,,,3,"This review is where I wish we could leave half stars.  3 1/2 would be my rating.  Cute little French place in the downtown Charlottesville area.  We ate outside which is a little loud, but the inside of the restaurant is pretty small.  The outdoor seating at least doubles the capacity.  Server was great, very attentive.  Little things bugged me life my knife was not clean, butter was given very sparingly, my lobster bisque while tasty had broken a little.  Over all the food was good, but for as small a place as this is the details are so important.  There were 3 in the party.  Ordered a bottle of wine and a glass of red for my friend. Wine pricing is pretty fair about 100% mark up so about normal.  Trout entrŽe was good, but the sauce while delicious was enough for one filet, but two came on the plate.  Hanger steak was inconsistent.  2 were ordered one was tender and one was not.  Unimpressed with the French onion soup, seemed to lack flavor.  All and all its a cute place in a cool setting, but with a little extra work on details it would be 4 star easy.",245,11,view review
33,,Stephanie T.,10/05/17,,,1,5,"This was our first stop when we returned to Charlottesville for vacation this year. Their menu is simple, fresh, and delicious. I never feel too full, and love having healthy options like the fresh kale salad as an appetizer and my husband had the frisee salad. For lunch I had Trout Amandine, which was flavored with black pepper, capers, and butter. Service was fast and pleasant. We will definitely be heading back for lunch again this week.",9,50,view review
34,,Langdon L.,20/06/17,,,,4,"Very quaint and attractive French bistro on the downtown mall. Limited seating makes it an intimate encounter if they're busy, and they have a large outdoor seating portion slightly removed from the traffic of the downtown mall. The wait staff was professional and were efficient in their service. Their steak frites were recommended, and were quite delicious. The meat was cooked a perfect medium-rare and was complimented with an appropriately large side of fries. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their french onion soup, and enjoying a cozy winter dinner inside or a beautiful spring/fall evening on their patio.",160,387,view review

36,,Angel H.,23/09/17,,,,5,"Loved Petit Pois! Excellent food, great service, and romantic atmosphere. The indoor seating is limited, but there's plenty of tables outside in the patio. The servers were attentive and friendly. Always asked if we wanted more bread and refilled our waters frequently! Service was also pretty fast. 

The wine was fantastic! I got the RosŽ Merlot 2016 and it was delicious. Fragrant but not too sweet- has a nice refreshing feel to it! The arugula salad was amazing. The dressing was perfect and so was the amount of shaved parmesan cheese. The pine nuts also added a really nice flavor. I got the Lamb Ragout and liked it a lot. The potato gnocchi was chewy and the smoked lamb was juicy and tender. The sauce was amazing! It was rich but not too greasy or salty and it paired so well with the gnocchi. My boyfriend got the steak and frites and really enjoyed it too! The steak was perfect medium- the outside was crunchy and the inside was super soft and juicy. 

A great place to get dinner! The restaurant has such an intimate, romantic feel to it and the piano jazz music they play is great. People are well dressed and the servers are awesome. My only complaint is that they do not validate parking.",510,454,view review

I had the coq au vin for my entrŽe.  It was really good. I had the cheese dish for my dessert course. It was just okay.  It was really a small and cramped space.

40,,Reilly S.,03/04/18,1,1,1,4,"Overall, I really enjoyed Petit Pois and highly recommend trying this French-style restaurant. While the fare is a bit pricier than other selections on the Downtown Mall, PP really is a step above the rest. The decor is intimate, but rustic, with a countryside interior and a nice outside deck. As the weather cools down in the late afternoon and early evening, the deck gives a nice view of the mall, perfect for a glass of wine with friends and family. The menu offers a variety of food items, with each dish built around seasonal, fresh ingredients. Each dish our group ordered highlighted local ingredients and demonstrated a deep attention to detail. Bellow is a description of the dishes I ordered:

Coq Au Vin: While I typically steer away from ordering chicken at restaurants, this bird was cooked beautifully. The meat was moist throughout and nearly fell off of the bone. The resulting wine sauce had a deep, rich flavor with a nice saltiness. The mushroom and carrot lardon on the top complimented the meal really well, adding nice earthy and herby flavors to the dish. The buttery, purred potatoes were also well executed, providing a great base to soak up the complex flavors.

Side of Brussels Sprouts: These were fantastic; the sprouts were really well roasted, crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside. The parmesan on top added a great saltiness while the bacon offered a rich hearty tone to the meal. The portion was very generous for $5 and ranks among the top in Charlottesville. Might come back to just order wine and a side of these!

Would definitely recommend going to Petit Pois. While the place is a bit small, the food is really well done and offers a nice deviation from the typical American/Southern food found on the mall. The waitstaff was very helpful and the ambiance relaxing and inviting.",101,608,view review

47,,Cassie P.,01/08/18,11,2,9,3,"There's something special about Main Street in downtown Charlottesville and the wide array of dining options is certainly part of that! On one particular evening, I was in the mood for some French food and landed at Petit Pois. 

I was alone and opted to sit outside on the patio where the hostess gave me a hightop table close to the action. I ordered mussels, French onion soup, and a glass of wine. Overall, it was a-ok but didn't leave me wanting to come back for more. I was particularly letdown by the French Onion Soup. Not sure if it wasn't hot enough or what, but the cheese was a strange texture and I found it all rather bland. The mussels were more flavorful but didn't have a ton of broth to soak up with the bread which is usually the best part! 

I don't know if it was because I was by myself, but the service could've also been better. I was there for a full meal but found the waitress to be inattentive and she didn't let me know of specials which I ended up overhearing her tell neighboring tables later on in my meal... It was my first time at the restaurant so a little more warmth would be appreciated and I would've also probably got dessert but didn't want to overstay my welcome.

The nice patio, people watching, and wine made up for some of the misses. I wouldn't completely discount returning here in the future to maybe try some other dishes, but I wouldn't come back alone.",1843,4027,view review

We were told there was a ""miscommunication"" and was offered outdoor seating because there weren't any available tables. Considering that is was 30 degrees outside, this was not a realistic option (even with the heat lamps we were promised). I would have appreciated an apology rather than being repeatedly told that it was a misunderstanding. What exactly did I misunderstand? We weren't given another time and the hist awkwardly stood next to us until we left. This was horrible customer service and poor organization.

I kept wishing for more bread to soak up the sauces of my party's other dishes. 

They did allow our dog to hang out with us which is a huge plus. It was also not terribly expensive for dinner, around $150 for four people with a bottle of wine. 

The only reason it's not a 5 star review was because of the service. It was pretty slow for a Friday night (outside seating full, indoor restaurant empty), but the wait staff still forgot things we asked for and did not check in with our table often enough.",37,21,view review

The pasta noodles were soft, lamb was a bit gamey, and the gnocchi with the sauce was bland. They all just tasted flavorless. 

However, the specials were on the other side of the spectrum. The crab cakes dish were seasoned while the pork tenderloin special was tender and juciy. Why the difference? I have no idea.

80,,Val C.,24/04/21,,1,,3,"I went here with my boyfriend to celebrate my birthday. The food was delicious--he got the crabcake and I ended up with the shrimp risotto (more on this later). The risotto was actually an appetizer but at $12 it's a super good deal as it's almost entree-sized. It was decadent and I could taste the parmesan in every bite! I tried a bit of my boyfriend's dish too--the crabcake was a little dry for my taste but overall the dish was good and he seemed to enjoy it a lot.

The service, on the other hand, was a disaster. As in, there was no service. Our server was the only employee working the front of house (there wasn't even a separate host/hostess) and had probably around 10 tables to cover. When we arrived, we waited for about 5 minutes to be seated by the server, which was fine, although the restaurant wasn't crowded at that point so that was a bit odd. I ordered the butternut squash risotto, but in our server's hurry I guess she put in the wrong order and that's how I ended up with an appetizer instead of an entree (although as I said earlier it was excellent so not a huge deal). Our server was nearly running from one table to the next the entire time we were dining, which was stressful to watch and honestly a bit distracting. We were not asked how our meal was once nor were our water glasses refilled despite being empty for 3/4 of the time we were there. Even getting our server's attention for the check was difficult because she would dash inside before we could catch her. 

Overall, the food was fantastic but this was probably the worst service I've had at a restaurant. Petit Pois should think about hiring extra staff or redistributing employee tasks, as they seem to be placing unmanageable responsibilities on their current staff.",14,45,view review
81,,Samantha H.,09/05/21,,,1,5,"This is nestled in a bit of a shadowy corner of downtown, so it never caught my eye, so I am glad I found reviews online that led me here! It was easy to get seated on Saturday lunchtime, and we chose to sit outdoors (we ended up being chilly because it was blustery and out of the sun but the warm food helped).

Between four people, we decided to go family-style with the appetizers of French onion soup, lamb mergeuz soup, and gnocchi. Due to an accident, we got the shrimp risotto (uncharged that we got to keep), and it ended up being one of the best apps. The lamb mergeuz soup was delectable, very unique in flavor and well-balanced in my opinion, bringing a good earthy meaty taste alongside the tender beans and carrots. The French onion soup was done well. While the risotto looked like it had been sitting out for a moment (a bit congealed looking), it tasted phenomenal and was the best risotto I've ever had. It was not overly cheesy or buttery, just perfectly creamy held up by some of the flavor of shrimp. The gnocchi ended up being the weakest app; while the gnocchi were so tender and pillowy, the flavors were confusing, dominated by salt and strangely mingling tangy, herby, and nutty flavors. 

I personally ordered the crab cake and loved my choice. Without excess breading, the crab cake was satisfying and had an excellent flavor including notes of citrus and mustard(?) that went great with the sweet creamed corn -- I was indifferent about the spinach. 

The appetizer portions are very generous! I was so satisfied by this meal and would love to come back again to try other menu items and see how it changes seasonally!",210,24,view review

I think I saw our server three times for drink order, food order and check. Never came back to ask how things were etc. Some other guy was attending to our table more than our waiter. The menu online vs in house was different along with the prices. Was a little disappointed when I had my mind set on one thing to find out it's not on the menu.

The wine was fine.
The beet and feta salad that my wife ordered, asking our waitress to kindly check that it was arugula free, as she is 911 allergic to it, duly arrived... almost completely arugula! A replacement eventually arrived with kale (the waitress told us it would be Romaine!) and some tiny little cubes of processed, very un-Greek feta.
I ordered the burger, medium rare, only to be told that it only came 'pink or not pink'. I chose the pink version. When it arrived it was...
grey, soggy, tasteless maybe related to a cow but not to a burger. I asked the waitress if she thought it was 'pink or not pink' and she agreed it was not pink and said sh'e'd get another one that would be, indeed, pink. She muttered something about 'sous vide' and the flag went up... so the replacement burger arrived and it was...

$13 - The lobster shrimp bisque was quite tasty and not overly salted like they usually are.  There was 1 shrimp cut into 5 pieces at the bottom of the bowl. It's be better with some lobster meat if they want to include the 1 shrimp. Otherwise, the flavors were there.

We ordered wine and an old fashioned and were about three sips in before our server was ""just letting us know"" the kitchen closes at 8. This was our first time visiting and didn't realize we would be on a time crunch having been offered a reservation at 7:45pm. He ultimately gave us the speech ""if it were up to me you could wait but the kitchen staff gets upset"". It was whatever. We knew what we wanted to eat we just weren't quite ready to order. 

I should mention that my wife's old fashioned was mostly watered down tasting. She orders these at dinner all the time and it was just not up to standards. See photo.

The salad greens jump at you with goodness; the salad is served with goat cheese & toasted pine nuts, the dressing is wonderfully subtle.  That's just for a starter.  The soups are yummy and so is one of my favs, the house smoked salmon with potato cake.  The mussels marinire are spot on classic and divine.  And you've never ever tasted such amazing Brussels sprouts!  In the summer the owner often brings in his own home grown tomatoes!   Some classic main courses here are the trout amandine which is addictive...you'll order it again & again, the coq au vin in the French style...super comfort food, the crab cakes have a lot of crab, and the hanger steak is tender and absolutely delicious!  Don't miss the shoe string French fries....cooked perfectly.  There's a superb selection of wines and lots of fun cocktails.  They serve three perfect desserts which are all fantabulous.  Petit Pois is my favorite Cville restaurant.  I'm sure you'll love it too!  (Reserve if eating inside...!)",16,,view review
98,,Findmefood O.,20/02/23,,,1,4,"This is a small, intimate restaurant with great service.  Unfortunately, I forget the name of our waiter (younger, African-American guy) but he was awesome despite the fact that I think he was the only one working the room aside from the young bus boy and hostess.  The food, drink/wine menus were nice.  We especially enjoyed the beet salad, French onion soup and the burger.  The vegetarian gnocchi were average, which cost them a star.  We didn't leave any room for dessert.",112,1,view review
99,,Emily S.,12/03/23,1,1,1,4,"Had dinner here this past Friday night. The trout entree is amazing. It's quite a big portion, actually. Lobster bisque was good. A little salty, I thought. It's very rich. This was definitely a decadent meal. The service was pretty good. It's a cute little intimate spot that's worth checking out. We thought the prices were fair for being a nicer quality restaurant. Good location.",86,225,view review
100,,Giovanni L.,25/03/23,,,,4,"The shrimp risotto was incredibly rich in flavor, and the service was overall good as they were attentive before you needed to ask. The tables don't get assigned one waiter so it's multiple people coming to your table which is alright, but I prefer one specific person. The food was amazing though!",49,100,view review

We had dinner on the patio surrounded by roses and listening to the gentle sounds of the waterfall and the muted strains of live jazz music from down the street.  The coq au vin was delicious and our waiter, Logan, was polite and attentive.  Great atmosphere, good food and outstanding service. Can't wait to go back!",10,,view review
104,,Mat G.,09/08/23,1,,1,5,"Saturday night, gorgeous weather, and patio dining in charming Charlottesville!  Quite the winning combination!
I ordered their lobster & shrimp bisque which was quite nice!  A little on the salty side but was nice.  Then came the entree of their Coq au Vin which I paired with a French Syrah.  Ohhh their Coq au Vin was some delightful chicken!  Prepared perfectly and it was just the right amount of juiciness and saturated with flavor.  
For dessert, I indulged in beignets that were excellent!
My waitress was very pleasant and helpful in coordinating me picking up the bill for my table.  
5/5 all around!",450,343,view review
105,,Lauren H.,20/08/23,,,,1,"I have been here before and has a fine meal with good service. However, last night I had one of the worst dining experiences of my life. We sit down and are forgotten. Eventually someone comes to take our order and we ask for some bread. Once again, they forget about us, and 45 minutes later the manager comes over to tell us that they lost our order. At this point we're mad. Eventually our appetizers come out, half assed and horrible. Our meals arrive and the crab cake was actually inedible and flavorless. It was not a good experience, however, they knew they severely messed up and only charged us half price.",3,,view review
106,,Adam T.,07/10/23,,,,1,"We came here for our anniversary. Had two hours until we needed to leave, which we thought would be sufficient. Drinks and appetizers delivered within 30 mins. After an hour, we wondered about the status of our crabcake and risotto.  We gave it a little longer, and then asked when parties who had arrived well after us were served. ""The food should be ready in just a few minutes."" Then another 20 mins passed, and I informed our waitress that if the food arrived within 10 mins, we would need it in a box. Beyond that, we would need to leave.

Another worried, neighboring table received their dinners. ""Hmm...that looks like what I ordered,"" I thought.

After a few more minutes, the manager delivered something. But sadly, it wasn't our food, but rather some disappointing news. Our order was lost. It was never prepared. And it wouldn't be prepared, not in the remaining time.

So they comped our drinks, my fairly tasty pea soup, and the nice tomato salad.

Very disappointing, not enough of a sincere apology from the waitress, and a promise from me that I will not be back.",12,,view review
107,,Ann K.,15/11/23,,,,5,"When did C'ville become such a foodie town?! What a fantastic dinner we had at Petite Pois!  We had an early 5pm reservation before seeing Dave Matthews and we sat next to another couple who had the same plan. 

My friend has a dairy and gluten allergy and they were able to accommodate her beautifully. We shared the beet salad with the goat cheese on the side (for me), trout amandine (made with olive oil instead of butter), and crab cake. Our meal was perfect. I would order all of these dishes again! The service was wonderful. We parked in the lot just around the corner. Just an overall delightful meal!",77,24,view review
108,,Charles L.,22/11/23,,,,3,"I had been here for dinner years ago and liked it quite a bit, so invited a guest speaker and colleagues for the meal after. You can only reserve a table inside so we did that, but when we got there we found that more people were outside. There were 9 of us and they gave us a long table against a corner, making it hard to get up and sit down. The servers were cheery but there were moments of confusion. Also the food was decent but not as hot as most of us would like.",25,41,view review

All of the staff are easy to talk to and food never disappoints us. My fiancŽe loved the Lamb Pastilla and I enjoyed their hanger steak and Mussels. Peti pois is definitely a gem in Charlottesville.,3,,view review

115,,Jen S.,30/05/24,2,1,2,5,"We came here on a busy Wednesday for lunch and were greeted and seated outside right away. You can sit inside too but it was a gorgeous day out. Seats were comfortable and had umbrellas with shade and beautiful flowering plants of all sizes around the courtyard. Our server was fantastic and we ordered libations first and then our main sides. My trout was so tasty, I could have ate 3 more since the filet was really small. My parents had the crab cake and said it was amazing too. Bathrooms were clean and I can't wait to go back to try something new!",272,236,view review
116,,Laura K.,08/06/24,,,,5,"We walked into this adorable French boutique restaurant and met Brandon our waiter.  He was super friendly, accommodating and went above and beyond to make our first experience spectacular.  We started with custom mocktails that were fabulous, mine was a citrus ginger flair and my friends a lime mint sparkling experience. Then we wanted everything on the menu, but decided to get three things and split them. We had a lovely beet, goat cheese arugula salad with a lovely citrus vinaigrette.  The beets were perfect and the dressing was divine. Then we had split the house burger with Swiss and onions and the house rosemary fries which were delectable, crispy and seasoned to perfection.  He even split the plate so we could keep it neat and didn't have to replace ourselves.  Then we split the crab cake and it too was awesome.  The corn coulis was amazing the crab was really meaty crab with an excellent but light flavor and I saw a hint of mustard seed. We then saw the table next to us endulge in profiteroles, and had to split those as well.  Brandon and Lindsey were amazing and I would highly recommend for a casual dining experience outdoors in downtown Charlottesville.  The fountains and greenery outside was relaxing and I almost felt I was at a French bistro in a side street of Paris. I will be back again.

119,,Joel F.,01/01/25,,,,5,"We have lived in Charlottesville for 7 years.  While we have only eaten at Petit Pois 4 times, it was the first restaurant we at at when we came up to initially look for places to live and it was the most recent place we have dine out, last night for NYE.
It is small and cramped.  They can't do anything about that.  The service has always been top notch, warm, hospitable, engaging and friendly without being over the top.  While nothing we have ever eaten there has been memorable; that isn't a slight.  Everything has always been good and of the value that we have paid.  A place like this with its' price point need to make good food that is better than what I can do at home and better than a chain or corporate ""faux"" bistro.  Along with the good food and the exceptional service they always hit the mark.
Last night was the 2nd time we have come in for a New Years Eve meal.  We live within walking distance to the downtown mall and we aren't party animals so we typically don't make NYE reservations and just walk down to the strip and see if we can saddle up at a bar somewhere.  Last week my fiancee mentioned that this year she would like to make reservations and go out.  I searched everywhere in Charlottesville and the surrounding area and all reservations were booked up.  Bummer.  So, we decided to do our regular routine, put on decent clothes and walk and see if we could slide in somewhere----our first choice as Petit Pois.  We go there and talked to the host to see if there was anything possible available, knowing the probability was low and we were OK with that.  The host checked, talked to his folks, came out and showed us to a table.  Yes, it was small and it was cramped but THEY MADE IT HAPPEN FOR US.  Everything was what we expected.  The food was good, the service as great, and the price was reasonable, and we had a nice meal and got home in time to watch the ball drop.
Thanks Petit Pois.  We will see you next New Years.",15,246,view review
