1,,Cindy P.,18/08/06,,1,1,5,"Not only is this what you want in a local mexican restaurant, but it is also located in an old house, which gives it a cozy feel.  I love the pollo con chorizo.  And if you want the best bang for your buck, go for the nachos supreme.  you'll be filled and will be delicious!  Their drinks are a little pricey, but splurge on the margarita if you want to get tipsy, they're usually pretty potent.  I love the Guad for its location (right there for JPA dwellers), filling, tasty dishes, and friendly service.",25,6,view review
2,,Mindy T.,17/12/08,,,,4,"Mmmmmmm - Guady's chips and salsa are tasty! I always got their combo plates that came with beans and rice - and it was always good. Their chicken enchiladas, chicken tacos, beef tacos... it's all tasty. Sometimes a little salty (a lot of Mexican places are), but still tasty! This Guadalajara is in a small house, so it's a cozy place to meet with friends. I also came here to order chips and salsa to go a few times when having friends over. Better than anything you can get in the grocery store!",44,3,view review
3,,JiaJia T.,18/02/09,,,,2,"If you like oversized and overly greasy mexican food, this is the place for you!  If you like quantity over quality then this will be your favorite restaurant.  Tasty food doesn't need to drown in cheese and fat.",571,572,view review
4,,Kara M.,19/02/09,,,,2,"greasy and not that great, i came here once and let's just say my stomach was NOT the least bit happy about it.",538,157,view review
5,,Andrew W.,14/03/09,,,,2,"I ordered the Guadalajara Special, and it was terrible. Salty sides, soggy fried bits slathered with cheese, and I ended up being unable to eat more than a quarter of the admittedly large portion.

The chips and salsa are the only reason this place gets a 2 instead of a 1. If I could go just for that, I would.",26,6,view review
6,,Mary W.,10/12/09,,,1,1,"Walking into the restaurant, I expected to recreate a meal in a Mexican restaurant that I had earlier that week with my boyfriend in Baltimore. At first, I was pleasantly surprised by the combination meals, which conveniently paired together many entrees so that you don't have to think too hard about how many tacos you want or whether you'll want to get an enchilada with it as well.

Well, when my dad & I finally got our food, I think I almost made a sad face. I knew that the combo meals would have smaller enchiladas & burritos, but at Guadalajara, the quality of the food was comprised as well. It was soggy, somewhat on the bland side and overall a huge disappointment.

The only thing good about the meal was the salsa & chips. And that's sad.",189,107,view review
7,,M B.,17/03/10,,,,5,"I love guad.  Try the a la carte soft chicken tacos, then smother them with the hot sauce on the table.  You won't be disappointed.  Also excellent frozen margs.",42,,view review
8,,Anthony Y.,24/07/10,1,,,2,"carnitas- pork was really dry and everything was greasy.. flavor was okay but have definitely have had better Mexican food

The Guadalajara down 29 (on Greenbriar Rd) is a lot better!",7,172,view review
9,,Jennifer M.,08/05/11,2,,2,4,"I came in here seriously doubting the place. It's actually not as small as it looks and the food is not as bad as I expected! After all the horror stories I've heard/read about soggy and salty food, I was seriously impressed.

First basket of chips+salsa is free. Additional baskets are $1. Makes me question why....  nothing special going on here.

I had the Fajitas de Carnitas. Most popular dish out of everyone's (8). I drool when I think of those flavorful, pull-apart chunks of carnitas that come out sizzling hot and tasty. Possibly the best carnitas I've ever had (certainly better than Chipotle! hahaha). Still not so sure about the rest of the overly large menu though...

Half priced jumbo margaritas all day on Sundays and Tuesdays! Available frozen or regular. So delicious. (I downed two of these myself)",497,459,view review
10,,Stanley S.,09/06/11,,,2,3,"They're skimpy on the price, but not on the chips. However, like most cheap Mexican restaurants, you get what you pay for which is high quantity and mediocre quality. 

I prefer to order off their a la carte menu and usually stick to their bean & cheese enchiladas. They are also pretty cool about doing a bit of dish customization up request like changing the sauce.",105,133,view review
11,,Amanda B.,27/06/11,,,1,4,"This isn't the closest to authentic Mexican food, but then again Charlottesville only has about a 5% Hispanic and Latino population. That being said, Guad is much better than a place like Azteca.

Our waitstaff was friendly in handling a large group, keeping chip baskets and drinks refilled. The food was pretty good. I ordered fish tacos and felt they were pretty good- not amazing mind you, but I was more than satiated. The salsa here also wasn't disappointing, which can make or break a Mexican restaurant.",24,1,view review
12,,Nick M.,10/03/12,,1,1,2,"OVERALL 2/5 This place is a bottom basement Mexican place which provides cheap, but relatively tasteless food and plenty of alcohol. Come here if you are looking for plenty of margaritas and something to shovel into your mouth along with them, otherwise look elsewhere.

FOOD 2/5
Not really even average, the food here tastes as cheap and quick as it is made. The low quality ingredients and mish-mash of premade items reminds me of a grade school cafeteria. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, it just doesn't really taste good. About one step up from a frozen Mexican TV dinner. 

DRINK 3/5
The restaurant shines in its ability to provide cheap alcohol. Not the greatest margaritas in the world by a long shot, but you can get a lot of them and have a good time.

AMBIENCE 3/5
There are a couple locations in Charlottesville, this one isn't the greatest but it isn't bad. About a dozen tables with nice warm colored walls. The big sell here is the limited amount of outdoor seating which makes this a very nice place in warmer weather.

SERVICE 3/5
No complaints, it is quick and I've never had a problem splitting a check. About what you would expect at a cheap restaurant.",22,,view review
13,,Susan J.,22/01/14,,,,3,carnitas are so amazingly delicious.  haven't had anything as good as theirs anywhere else.  but bathroom is gross.  guacomole seems to be spicy some days and not the other.  service is pretty bad.  but i come back for the carnitas and carnitas only...,432,11,view review
14,,Elle P.,02/06/14,,,1,5,"Yea yea-it's americanized mexican food but the waiters are the nicest in Charlottesville-hands down and the service is fast! If you want to stink to the more fresh, higher quality authentic items on the menu, I would recommend the black bean soup which is DEEE-lish. Fresh made every day. Ask for extra cheese & pico de gallo. Also, try the tacos de carnitas-out of this world!",9,,view review
15,,Sarah H.,21/06/14,,,,4,"The salsa and chips here are delicious. Let's be real, we love the free stuff. The salsa is spicy and chips crispy.

The service here is amazing. It might be because they're never really that busy but the refills and food come out quickly. 

I love the fajitas. The portions are so big that you have at least one meal left over. Skip the sangria. The margaritas are strong and delicious.",42,4,view review
16,,Leah B.,18/07/14,,,,5,"Guadalajara has treated my husband and I well since we were dating in high school. This is, and will always be a favorite location for us--and we will visit all of the Guaralajara's as often as we can. Great food, great service, friendly environment--a wonderful place to visit. Try the Carnitas next time you're there, and you won't be disappointed!",9,2,view review
17,,David D.,18/12/14,,,,4,"We were an hour from Richmond in Charlottesville,Va  looking for a place to eat. Found this place on Yelp and ate. Service was great and waitress very pleasant and helpful. The food was also wonderful and full of flavor.",55,2,view review
18,,Victoria N.,21/02/15,,,,5,"This place is awesome. Service is EXCELLENT. Place is clean and cozy. And the fooood yum. Free chips amd spicy salsa upon sitting down. The food came out fast and delicious. The rice, beans, and guac sides are fresh and tasty. There are many delicious options, the lunch specials are very cheap, and everyday they have some sort of deal or special. Drink prices are very very reasonable. This place is also a great location for students living on JPA. Definitely a must-try.",397,463,view review
19,,Stephanie B.,27/04/15,,,,3,"This would probably be a 3.5 if I had the option. It's a good standard neighborhood Mexican place, but don't expect the best meal of your life. My meals have been hit or miss - I enjoyed the Burrito California, not so much the #F. My husband really likes the chimichangas. Service is hit or miss too. You can tell management cares about customer service, but there seem to be a number of really inexperienced, untrained servers. Twice I've asked for queso and been asked if I mean ""the sauce or the shredded kind."" It's got a nice ambiance and has some good daily specials.",39,6,view review
20,,Thuan T.,27/05/15,,,,4,"Guad is a solid place to go for cheap Mexican food. Has a pretty plentiful menu with a section that is specifically different combos you can get at a really good price. 

The portions are deceptively large and you wouldn't expect it at first because it's so cheap, but don't overestimate yourself when you're ordering food because you might overwhelm yourself like I did. Free bowl of chips and salsa when you first sit down, which holds you over nicely until the food comes.

The food came very quickly and service was fairly good. I got the Burrito California which was absolutely massive and quite tasty. Sundays and Tuesdays are also margarita special days where you can get cheap jumbo margaritas. I am partial to sangria so I ordered one during a special and got a $4 sangria which tasted great.

I also participated in an Orderup taco eating contest where I got to eat a buttload of Guad tacos, which was pretty awesome. Their tacos are nothing extraordinary, but they are certainly better than what you would find at Taco Bell or whatever.",137,469,view review

22,,J B.,04/08/15,,,,3,Long wait time for food.  Waiter forgot to ask what drinks we wanted initially.  Tacos are good.  Enchiladas ok.  The slow speed service and food quality hurt the business.  Portion sizes are good.  I gave 3 star rating and may not choose this place again.,1,,view review
23,,Glenn H.,05/09/15,,,,2,"My enchiladas were dry and bland. I'm willing to bet they pre-make a lot of the menu items, and then zap them in a microwave. Our server didn't check up on us to see if we needed drink refills or anything else. He seemed to be in waaaay over his head, and the restaurant was only 1/4 full. I'll pass.",105,,view review
24,,Sage P.,06/09/15,,,2,2,"I like this restaurant but of all of them in Charlottesville this is the one that I've gotten the worst service. We spilled a water and our waitress told us that she ""didn't have time"" to help us clean it up. There were only 4 other tables in the restaurant and there was another server. She was continuously rude and I will be going to the other guadalajaras from now on.",14,671,view review
25,,Janice P.,20/10/15,,,,3,"Guadalajara does the job if you're looking for good, cheap Mexican food. The location is so convenient for anyone living on JPA, first basket of chips and salsa is free (though you can get more for free if you order an app), and combos are very, very reasonably priced. Service is nice and the place is small but has a fun ambiance. 

I'm a huge fan of guacamole and queso, so we got the choriqueso (queso + spicy chorizo yummm) and guac for the table. So worth every penny, particularly the choriqueso omg. I could eat that as an entree just with chips. Great kick, warm and melty, crispy tortilla chips...so great. 

The chicken quesadilla I got was a little disappointing, more like a taco than a quesadilla in my opinion. But sharing a yummy jumbo margarita with my friend of course made everything better. And choriqueso! ¡Sí, a mi me gusta!",103,248,view review
26,,Mrs. B.,02/12/15,,,,3,"Mediocre experience. This is the only Mexican restaurant I have been to with a limit on chips, and it's not like they are that amazing. Our server created for a very tense and awkward vibe. She was very serious, never smiled, and seemed bothered by our requests. I ordered the shrimp quesadilla; it was ok, I have definitely had better elsewhere.",5,,view review
27,,Asha N.,10/12/15,,,,5,I love this place! Walking distance for UVA campus students and from JPA residents. The prices for the food is inexpensive and tastes very authentic to me! I love spicy food so ask for their homemade hot sauce! I come here almost every week and rheir lunch and combo deals are amazing! I sometimes even have left overs so the portion sizes are acceptable for the price :),13,79,view review
28,,Caroline F.,18/12/15,,,,3,"Decent. I ordered the chicken fajitas and it came out looking like a stir fry. It wasn't all that flavorful, and didn't come with any toppings. The one thing they have is decent prices- their lunch specials are small in size but you can get a meal for $5. I also enjoyed the chips and salsa.",326,330,view review

30,,Marie M.,01/05/16,,,,2,"What happened Guad? We been going to all the wonderful Guadalajara restaurants in town forever and this service was here was slow. Not sure if there is new management or if they were short staffed but every empty table here has dirty food dishes on it, and we JUST got our waters to drink after 25 minutes of being of here. We sat ourselves as no one was here to help us and we had no one even come to our table for over 15 minutes (till I went to back to ask someone to come see us).  We aren't hard to please people, but with if you've been a long time local you've come to know Guad as a place for great QUICK and CHEAP food. They also did away with Sunday kids eat free, which they've had forever. 
Lastly, there are o my two other small tables of people here, yet EVERY other table in the whole restaurant minus one is full of dirty dishes from the last customer.  Will now take pics which are from being here for 45 minutes and all these tables were vacant when got here with those same dishes.",3,,view review
31,,Victoria F.,04/06/16,,,,4,"My husband and I recently went to Guadalajara's in a different location and had agreed that we would not ever go again due to the food being terribly bland.  We had friends talk us into trying it again, though at a different location and WHAT a difference!  The salsa had a nice kick to it and the food was incredibly delicious.  I had the Chicken enchiladas and asked for hot sauce on the side.  The waiter brought out some that they make there at the restaurant.  This hot sauce was amazing.  It put the meal on the next level!  I will absolutely go back now, plus they have good margaritas!",136,106,view review
32,,James D.,20/06/16,,,,1,If time is not important to you then this might be your place.  After waiting 25 minutes just for the drink order we knew it was time to exit.  This is the second time of long waiting for service and the last time.  The place was empty so there was no excuse.,5,,view review
33,,Alexandria T.,19/07/16,,1,,4,"I have dined in and gotten takeout from Guadalajara several times over the past couple of years. It's super close to my apartment, and they always have coupons to make the already affordable food even more so. There usually is no wait and the service is speedy. The food itself isn't anything special, but it does satisfy cravings for Mexican. My go to order is either a chicken fiesta taco salad or a shrimp quesadilla.They both are super filling and tasty.  I have also ordered the combination platters, which are a ton of food. Another thing they offer is drink specials during the week. If you're in the mood for quick, affordable Mexican, Guadalajara is the place to go!",755,577,view review
34,,Taylor C.,15/08/16,,,1,3,This place is ideal for a quick cheap meal and a jumbo margarita. If you're expecting more...don't. It's in walking distance for me so a great spot to hit up for happy hour (expect a strong drink).  I love their tacos al pastor but wish they had fresher chips and salsa. Some poor service but others days great service so it's kind of hit or miss. They have some great quesadillas and you are served large portions but overall it's pretty average hot plate Mexican food.,3,,view review
35,,Nichole M.,21/08/16,,,,4,This place usually has pretty slow service but the food is absolutely amazing. Favorite Mexican restaurant in town and I always bring friends here when they come to visit. Worth the wait for the food. Just be prepared to pay extra for chip refills !,34,,view review
36,,Laura H.,12/10/16,,,,3,"I have dined there and the service and the food were great. However, I've gotten takeout twice and they have gotten my order wrong both times. Each time, the staff was friendly about changing it.",7,45,view review
37,,Clarissa B.,22/01/17,,,,4,"I really like the environment, the waiters, and how fast the food arrives. It's fair priced, but as far as vegan options go, it lacks quite a bit. The only dish I eat from there is their vegetarian fajitas, with a great seasoned mushroom. Ask the beans with no queso, and you'll be fine! It's really one of my favorite mexican restaurants in town.",20,64,view review
38,,Sebastian L.,20/04/17,,,1,2,"Ordered delivery Sunday afternoon, was very disappointed.  Tried the fajita quesadilla and it was abysmal.  Lacked flavor, peppers and onions were still fairly raw, and the cheese was barely melted.  I also tried a beef taco and it was very disappointing.  Every topping costs extra so I just got it plain and the beef was very bland.  Needless to say, this was my last time at Guadalajara.  

One small silver lining were the rice and beans.  The combination really packed a punch.  Overall, skip this Charlottesville ""staple"".",14,20,view review
39,,Jay E.,20/04/17,,,,4,"Pretty solid food and cheap for lunch.

I got the carnitas fajitas (don't think I've ever seen that before, at least at a place like this) lunch special for $7.50 (plus tax and tip). Came with the pork and veggies (both good!), as well as rice and beans and 4 tortillas (I got corn). Plus chips and salsa included. A lot of food for the price, and it was quite good. The pork was seasoned well and tender. Chips, salsa, rice and beans all about average for a place like this. Service was fine, food came out quickly. They have daily drink specials too; today (Thursday) was beer.

Definitely recommend for lunch; next time I'll probably try the more breakfast-y items (huevos!) on the lunch special menu.",10,,view review
40,,Joe P.,17/05/17,,,,1,"The new winner of the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever eaten in, and I travel all over the country.  Horrible doughy enchiladas and some horrible dough like thing covering the chile Relleno.  One tablespoon of beans and two tablespoons of rice.  Just horrible.",3,,view review
41,,Brian S.,31/05/17,,,,5,"Yo, this Guad is hands down the best in cville. Now, granted you have to like spicy- their meals are ten times hotter than all the other Guadalajaras. The Chicken Quesadilla Michoacána is legit, the best. 
Also jumbo margaritas aren't bad (even though they taste like Mountain Dew?)",23,100,view review
42,,Jeff W.,13/06/17,,,,3,"Carne Asada Tacos come with 3 pieces of limp, tough, flavorless beef.  The jalapeño is grilled whole and not really suited for dividing between tacos. Chips and salsa apparently need to be paid for separately and don't come with the order, and there is barely any salsa with the chips.  3rd time ordering with them, and still unimpressed.",1,,view review
43,,Wei L.,04/07/17,1,,,4,"I came here on the last day of exams with a few of my remaining surviving classmates hoping for a good meal, good drinks, and a laid back time. And that's exactly what we got. I've always heard Guadalajara has been a cornerstone of JPA dining and I'm glad to know it lives up to the name. The place was surprisingly packed on a weekday night, but my friends and I were still able to be seated relatively quickly. The selection on the menu is pretty expansive and fairly authentic, but the best part of the menu has to be the drinks. This place has so many great drink deals, with deals for specific nights, and fairly cheap margaritas year-round. I ordered what can only be described as a 32 oz. goblet of margarita and it was the perfect consistency and sweetness. For dishes, we ordered combination dinner plates (chalupas), fried mozzarella sticks, and quesadillas. The food came out piping hot (and in huge portions), good to the last bite. The only con about this place is that during busy times, there is a slight pressure to move people along throughout the meal in order to get more tables turned. Overall, great dining experience with a very live atmosphere and great drinks to unwind after a long day. Will be back soon and often!",94,213,view review

46,,April H.,22/08/17,,,1,4,"I've been meaning to try Guadalajara for years...it was satisfying and I want to come back again to try more things on the menu. The menu is so extensive! We had a group of 8 people and were seated in a nice kinda private room. (Also, note that this location has a parking lot behind it! You can't really see it from the street.) Our server was very nice - he did forget to bring us water once and we had to remind him, but it wasn't a big deal and he did everything else well. 

First of all, the chips and salsa are great and we got free refills! I got the Tacos de Carne Asada and the mandarin Jarritos for my drink (a Mexican soda that comes in various flavors and that I recommend trying). The carne asada wasn't the best I've ever had, but as a whole I really enjoyed the tacos. You get your own personal salsa, cilantro, tomatoes, and onions so you can put whatever you want in your taco. The portion was pretty big - I was the only one out of three girls who got the same dish to finish all three of my tacos, and I was stuffed at the end. 

It was a great place to end the week with friends and eat some good Mexican food. I'd like to come back!",190,61,view review
47,,Desirae E.,30/08/17,,,,4,"I love coming to this Guadalajara location. The service is fantastic, and we always seem to come with large parties at late dinnertime. They are always accommodating and kind to us. 

The food is always delicious. Often my husband and I can share something plus maybe a side each and be nice and full, so it is quite an affordable option. I love getting something off of their specialties part of the menu, but I have to admit it takes me forever to look through the super long menu options.

One thing I don't love is that it feels cramped in this location. The other Guad locations have a lot more room, but this one is conveniently close to downtown which may be why there is less space. The bathrooms are super small and cramped as well. However, that doesn't take away from the good food and great service! It just means you may have a wait or just a cramped space to sit and move around.

Overall this is a great spot downtown!",200,371,view review
48,,Philip D.,16/10/17,,,1,5,"One of the best Mexican restaurants in town. Their Burrito Loco is the absolute best burrito in the history of mankind. It is huge and stuffed with the best chicken, steak, chorizo, rice, beans you could possibly eat. Easily my favorite dish. They always fix a great house hot sauce to dip it in too. Wife enjoys the vegan black beans, rice and guacamole dish, too. All the wait staff is friendly and the order is never a long wait. Inexpensive and Val Pak coupons cut the price somewhat, too. Recommend to anyone for the quality food and service.",11,21,view review
49,,Morgan H.,29/10/17,,,,4,"I tried this place while visiting Charlottesville and was pleasantly surprised by the quality, selection and prices. The free yellow corn chips, served at the beginning, were perfectly salted, crisp and not too dry. I enjoyed the salsa which was spicy with lots of cilantro...my favorite! The Shrimp Cocktail served in a large margarita glass was loaded with shrimp, avocado, cilantro and jalapenos in a light tomato based sauce... so good! They also had reasonably priced margaritas that were good but a bit sweet. These were large portions so expect to have  leftovers or share.

56,,Dusk C.,25/09/18,,,1,1,"I called this restaurant tonight and politely inquired if a to-go order I was picking up was ready for pick up. The person who answered the phone said, ""I don't know"" and abruptly hung up on me. When I went inside to pick it up, I asked for the manager. The gentleman who handed me the order said he was the manager. I explained to him what happened and was taken aback when he replied that it was he who had answered the phone. He smiled insincerely and said, ""Sorry, I was busy"", then he turned and walked away towards the kitchen. I looked around and there was only one table of customers in the whole place, not that it would have excused his behavior even if they were busy. I can't even comment on the food because I was picking it up for someone else but this experience definitely takes away any desire for me to want to go here ever or recommend this place to anyone.",38,48,view review
57,,Oak Z.,31/01/19,,,2,5,"There is simply no reason this place should be getting anything below 5 stars.  Having been here more than a dozen times, I can confirm that Guadalajara has the best Mexican food in Charlottesville hands down.  Oh, did I mention the frozen Matador Margarita is also probably the biggest and best margarita you can get on this side of the border?  If I had pockets deep enough I would be here for lunch and dinner every single day.  The food is always fresh and is served quickly, wait staff are exceptional and I have never had to ask for more water.  Side note: the menu says extra chips are $1 after the first basket but they usually do not charge for more baskets of their homemade tortilla chips.  Everyone I have taken to lunch or dinner at this fine Mexican restaurant has had nothing but positive things to say about it.  Make it a priority to try Guadalajara for your next dining out and you will not regret it.  11/10 would recommend.",130,486,view review
58,,Amanda B.,24/02/19,,,,1,"So I went here with a group of people on Saturday night (2/23/2019), and while the food itself was pretty good, I dont think i've ever received such awful service?

We ordered our drinks soon after sitting, but we didnt get them until 10 minutes later, and with that, two of the party members did not receive their orders. He brought them their margarita/mojito another 5 minutes later. We had to wait ANOTHER 20 minutes before we were even asked what food we wanted to order.

During this time, another table had been sat down ( about 10 minutes after us) , they had received their drinks, AND ordered their food, AND then they RECEIVED their food soon after we had just ORDERED ours. 

By the time we actually got our food, the other table was long gone. Unfortunately, we had to wait another 20 minutes before we actually got our checks after our food had been cleared.  Frankly I was disappointed with the service because my roommate had experienced something similar but I had hoped it was just a fluke in service that day. 

The worst part was, when I had asked the waiter why our service had been so spotty, he just laughed and nodded at me, like I was joking?  I will not  be returning in the future.",2,234,view review

The people are always great, the food hasn't always been consistent and that's why not 5 stars, but that's the only complaint I can say. I can't say I have a favorite food Iv tried so many different dishes and enjoyed them all, favorite drink I can say is the margaritas!",168,,view review

But, I guess, you don't go this restaurant for great food.  I was visiting the area, but there is a similar Mexican restaurant that has much better food, is authentic Mexican, and relatively cheap.",11,16,view review

Had to fetch ketchup from another table ourselves. Would not bring extra napkin requested and did not check back to refill drinks. Business was a bit slow. Will give them one more try. But hope they don't let the quality of food and service 
slip and that this was just an off day.",8,,view review

68,,Christina Z.,05/05/20,1,1,,4,"As a self-proclaimed picky Mexican food person (lived in Texas and the Southwest), I was very pleasantly surprised by this Guadalajara location! I've been here in pre-COVID times for food and margaritas before going to a UVA football game with a group of friends (recommend for a fun activity once we return to a sense of normalcy), but found the food very average at the time. After ordering delivery recently, however, I was much happier with the food we got and want to give them a shout out during these hard times of food delivery!

We got the nachos texanos which was reminiscent of Tex-Mex vibes with its grilled fajita style chicken, steak, and shrimp topped with onions and bell pepper. The shrimp and steak were super tasty, but was a little masked by the liquid cheese sauce (bias note: I prefer melted shredded cheese on nachos). It felt pricey at $18, but the portion was huge!! Enough to share between 2 people and have some leftovers. I also appreciated that they gave us extra chips on the side so it wouldn't get too soggy! Overall, I think worth it for the price/portion/taste!",360,52,view review
69,,Betsy T.,12/05/20,,,,1,"The scene on Cinco de Mayo was NOT good with people picking up orders.  Very few masks, no social distancing. Disappointing to see Charlottesville public, clearly anxious for food from an overworked restaurant on this holiday, behaving so badly.  We should have walked away.  Not the restaurant's fault, they didn't have the staff to control or perhaps anticipate this.  But NOT a good scene.",1,70,view review

The downtown restaurant and the Pantops restaurant. Went to Pantops first and then Downtown the next day for dinner with my Mom. The fajitas ingredients were juicy and the frozen margarita did its job! Good all around!",50,36,view review

I went in to pick up an order and several customers were sitting without masks while not drinking/eating. When it's busy, there is no way to socially distance while waiting to pick up your food.

A little on the pricier side in my option, but the portions are pretty big so it usually lasts me two meals. Great spot for a night out with friends or a date!",168,27,view review

They also have several sauces that come with their tacos including a salsa verde with a mild amount of heat, and a salsa roja that is spicier and has more of a kick to it.

82,,Kimberly C.,30/09/22,,,,5,"Food was wonderful and traditional. Husband ordered taco salad, me a salsa verde burrito. Their guacamole is Devine and it's the only guacamole I've ever liked! Not sure what's different than others I've eaten before, yet this one I really liked with the first taste. The pork in my burrito was tender and not over seasoned so the pork flavor shined through. We like simple, good food when we choose a Mexican restaurant. And this fits the bill beautifully! The wait and front of house staff were the kind of service you want, attentive, yet not overbearing and quick to respond graciously. (Other wait staff at other restaurants can sometimes make you feel that you've inconvenienced them in some)-not the case here. They were all awesome. Can't say enough about their food and service, yet of you're in this part of cville, they're worth the stop!",1,,view review
83,,Emma E.,29/10/22,,,,2,"Im updating my review now bc I'm surprised with how much I feel like my opinion has changed since last year. The takeout prices are pretty steep now ($17 for a chicken burrito with rice and beans???) and the portions are way smaller than they used to be. I got maybe 2 spoonfuls each of rice and beans and a ""burrito"" that was literally just bland grilled chicken inside a flour tortilla covered in queso. Seriously? For how much they're charging now I'm disappointed and feel like they're falling off. Not impressed. There was no one at the desk to help when I came in either. My chips came without any salsa. They may just be a good spot to get a cheap margarita if you're a student now. At least their patio is pretty nice. I'd just rather go grab food from El Amanecer, at least I won't leave hungry.",249,18,view review

97,,Kristin R.,26/01/25,,,,2,"My family has been going to Guadalajara at the Greenbrier location for over 20 years, but unfortunately, the quality and service have significantly declined over the last 5+ years.

On a recent visit with a friend, our menus had food on them--it was really disgusting. When we informed our server and asked for new menus, he responded, ""I only work on the weekends,"" and he didn't bring us clean menus. We had to ask someone else for help. The floors are another issue--not only sticky but also slippery like they haven't been properly cleaned in a while.

Overall, it's the service that has been so terrible. Waiting forever to place an order, to receive the bill, and even just to get basic attention from staff has become the norm. Yesterday, when I arrived to pick up a takeout order, two staff members walked right by me without making eye contact or asking if I needed assistance.

While I've started going to the Pantops location for dining in because it's much cleaner and the service is better, I've continued getting takeout from Greenbrier since it's just two minutes from my home. Sadly, even that has been disappointing.",5,21,view review

I called to place a to go order and I spoke to someone (a male.) He took my order but the interaction I had with him over the phone did not fill me with any confidence that the order would correctly executed. (All I ordered was a taco salad with beef and no sour cream.) After about 15 minutes I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my order. I told the boy at the front what I ordered and I came to find out, from him, that not only was my order incorrect but that the order had not been placed at all! The boy up front even had the nerve to ask me if I'd called the right store. I only have one Guadalajara phone number saved in my phone and I only order from one store in the area (Greenbrier location.) All I could do was take a deep breath, turn around  and leave. Customer service in that location has been, in my opinion, on the decline for quite some time now. I'm done. I will no longer be a Guadalajara customer.",1,5,view review
