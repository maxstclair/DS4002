Lindsay T.,9/9/07,,,3,1,"There's a mad rush in cville to cash in on the upscale restaurant trend, and this restaurant seems to have rushed a little too quickly.  The food was really good, and really pricey, but the service was HORRIBLE.  First, you don't give a new waitress an 8 person table outside when the restaurant is 25 yards away and upstairs.  Second, the waitress forgot 4 different food orders, and would have forgotten more if we hadn't reminder her.  Third, she was slow as a snail getting all of our drinks and coming back to check-in on us.  Finally, they include 20% gratuity for parties larger that 6.  We had no way to give her any feedback because she automatically got an extremely generous tip from us.  

I went and spoke with the manager about the situation, more as constructive feedback than as ""I'm so angry and want free dessert"", and she seemed to appreciate it.  As I sat down after talking to her, the waitress came up to our table and said ""I'm sorry you've had such an unpleasant evening"".  Instantly, everyone felt bad that she was so upset, but at the same time, that is so awkward for her to say anything at all.  She looked like she was crying too...

So to make matters worse, the manager was tactless enough to reprimand the waitress while we were still seated.",469,117,view review
Scott L.,6/7/08,,,2,1,"My singular worst dining experience I have ever had. The atmosphere is sophisticated & modern, the fish is extremely great quality but the overshadowing problem is the service is abysmal.

Dining on a holiday weekend the two of us were perfectly comfortable dining at the sushi bar. Unfortunately your seats are below the height of the workspace so you can't actually watch the chef work.  Our waiter was unhelpful in making suggestions and only made vague pretentious statements to my date to ""dive into the menu"".  The snobby attitude continued to the runners who dropped plates off at the shortest point to walk than putting the dish front of us. I realize the kitchen was busy but 2 of my items arrived before the edamame my date ordered. When I asked when my date's selections were coming out the waiter dismissed my question. The second time we expressed our surprise at how long it took for edamame to arrive the waiter realized he had not put in the order. The third time we asked and our waiter told a runner the runner looked straight at my date and rolled her eyes.

For $62, we ordered a salad, 2 small sticks of garlic meat, 2 small sticks of chicken citrus, a very good toro, and they still billed us for the edamame that never arrived. When we called the waiter over to show him he didn't even know it had never arrived. I left the free chocolate dessert in disgust.",62,262,view review
Pear M.,20/10/08,2,,,5,"I just love this place way too much to not give it a full 5 stars.  I got to go back this past weekend and service was much better.  I was sad to see they had changed their Specials menu and I was without my Lucky 7 roll.  Everything else was just as delicious as I had expected though.  

Thanks Ten!",107,63,view review
Marco S.,10/11/08,2,,1,4,"I've only ever been here for drinks, so stay away from me if you need an honest critique of the food.  However, the bartender told me they were lowering a lot of their menu prices in lieu of recent turmoil, so it is just the time to check out a place you know you've been curious about.
As far as lounging and drinking , this is a great spot on the downtown mall.  
The decor is pretty unique and original, and not just in a ""this is a town with only 50k people what do you expect"" sort of way, but in a ""hey, I'd even hang out here in midtown"" sort of way.
Delicious array of sakis, some of which are served in traditional cedar boxes are a nice touch, as are the comfortable couches next to ridiculously large windows overlooking the action on the downtown mall.",283,129,view review
Christine R.,11/11/09,,4,7,2,"Disappointment with a capital 'D'.

Now, I'm not normally a 2-star rater, but this is definitely all Ten is worth.  This place came highly recommended, so I expected to be blown away, but instead was completely turned off.

The service was so bad I am embarassed and ashamed for them.

We were celebrating a very special milestone birthday for a close friend, and when I told the waiter he just looked at me blankly and said, 'Oh' (as in 'Oh, big deal').  There was no comp'd drink or free dessert or anything.  Our bill came to a whopping $271.08 and not even one measly free edamame pod??

Another problem we had with our waiter is that we complained about the stupidly expensive wild sashimi platter (Omakase) we had which HE had recommended - it was so below average and we were very unimpressed.  We asked him several times to relay our message to his management and/or the sushi chef.  His response was, ""My roommate is the sushi chef, I'll tell him later"".  I should have told him we'd pay him ""later"", then.  If there's ever a place I wanted to do a dine-n-dash, this was it.

I should mention that the calamari appetizer was delicious, and the crab sushi roll was fairly tasty.  Everything else was meh.

Get your act together, Ten.  Hip decor does not fool me.  This place is sub-par and not just for us West Coast sushi snobs.",76,10,view review
Amanda H.,1/10/10,,2,5,1,"I'll carry on the trend, but yes, Ten is overpriced.  $15 for a spicy tuna roll is absurd, but I pay absurd prices when it is justified by extreme deliciousness, fabulous service, and outstanding atmosphere.  None of those three elements were met, and thus, there is absolutely no reason to check out Ten.  

We arrived at 6:15 on a Tuesday evening.  The restaurant was almost empty.  There were 2 tables set to accommodate larger groups (6+) but the remaining 7 booths in the front of the space were empty.  We were sat at a small table that is awkwardly set between booths and in front of the waiters' computer and when I asked whether we could sit in one of the many empty booths we were told no, that they were planning on being too busy.  This was upsetting enough, but I thought that maybe there was something I was unaware of.  Nope.  By the time we left maybe 75 minutes later the restaurant was just as empty as when we arrived.  I should have just walked out when we were told No.  Alas, we didn't.

Besides the maitre d, the server was friendly enough.  No real complaints there.  And the food was fine.  Not even close to worth the price.  Even a simple cucumber roll is $5 (a tool by which I often measure the priceiness of sushi restaurants.  Even my favorite hoity toity DC sushi place only has $4 cucumber rolls).

Anyway, the maitre d's attitude put a sour taste in my mouth and none of the food was delicious enough to remove it.  I'd look for a different sushi joint if I were you.",60,16,view review
Mei O.,23/01/11,,1,4,2,"This place would make a great date night, it has a cute hipster vibe, it's dimly lit, techno playing a little too loudly in the background, and the prices show you care.

We must have gone on an off night though, because the sushi we had was not fresh. Overall, the taste was good, but the tuna had a faint fishy taste, which means that it was getting close to the point of no return.  

This was upsetting, because of how expensive everything is on the menu. We ordered the honey chicken appetizer, and for $6, we got two small pieces of chicken on half skewers. Really? The annoying part was that our waiter didn't seem to think we had ordered enough/spent enough money.  He only checked on us twice during the dinner, and the second time was when we were done eating and if we would be ordering something else (after he recommended that we should probably get another plate of food), when we told him we were done, he walked away looking very irritated and promptly brought us our check. I guess $50 for two people just wasn't enough for him.",242,36,view review
Steph L.,21/02/11,,1,4,2,"You're paying too much for ambiance here---- the food was way overpriced and not THAT good.  the wagyu tenderloin was tasty, but everything else we ordered (skewers, salad, etc) were just ok.  our waiter seemed to be more interested in being good looking and charming than being knowledgeable and/or attentive.
bottom line:  go somewhere else!",35,24,view review
Taylor M.,3/6/12,,1,2,4,"Ten is underrated on Yelp. The food is fresh, and the staff is really helpful. The menu is big, with lots of options for people who like sushi, and those who don't. The staff accommodated our large group, and our waiter was so helpful for my pregnant sister, who loves sushi, but can't eat anything raw right now. They were also helpful in finding an appropriate meal for a two year old, who ended up loving his rice and fish. My personal favorite was the avocado tempura, but everyone loved their dinners. 

This restaurant could do well in any metropolitan area. The only criticism I have is that the decor is a little outdated. The restaurant is a bit dark (the whole room feels grey/blue), and it feels less friendly than it should. With a little update, the restaurant would be charming, as well as so tasty!",13,192,view review
John L.,21/02/13,1,3,6,1,"I was going to give Ten a 2-Star rating, because for as bad as my experience was, the food was marginal, but I couldn't do it.

That being said, the interior looked nice and anything good I have to say about Ten will stop there. 

Ten can jack up their prices because they have the best fish in Charlottesville. Sadly, that isn't saying a whole lot. I've paid $10+ for the standard 2 piece nigiri selections once in my life somewhere in Beverly Hills, and for as good as it was, it still hurts to pay that much. But $10 for two pieces of salmon? In Charlottesville? If the fish was monstrous I might not have been as annoyed, but it was your average sized piece of sushi.

It was my fault that I didn't look more carefully at the online menu disclaimer stating that the price was per piece and not for a two piece serving, so when I got there with my parents to treat them to dinner, I was caught off guard and couldn't work up the nerve to get up and find someplace else to eat after we'd already been seated and looked at the menus. I probably should have.

For me, the decent quality of the food merited at least three stars. The pricing dropped it down to two. The staff nuked it into a one.

I was coming back from the bathroom after I had washed my hands before the meal and two of the servers were standing in the doorway that leads into the kitchen area in the hallway with their backs to me. This is what I hear:

""You can have the Asian table""
""F**k that, and get no tips? It's your turn anyway.""

The guy that tried to hand us off was midsentence responding when they saw me walk by.

Bill came out to over $200 for just nigiri with no alcohol, I left zero tip for that idiot. My dad and I each ate a burger at Five Guys because we were still hungry.

Never going again.",59,202,view review
Joy G.,9/3/13,,1,,4,"Review's only for the separate lounge area and the delicious sake mojito with giant chunks of ginger; I can't say anything about the food, only that the portions looked tremendously tiny, the presentation was pretty, and I'm sure everyone leaving still had growling stomachs. I've been spoiled rotten by too many all-you-can-eat sushi places in New York, and short of miracle fatty tuna, I can't justify to myself shelling out $10 for a measly few pieces. It really is too bad that Charlottesville is stupidly land-locked, and this place has pretty much got the fish market cornered; I can count on one hand the (good) Japanese restaurants in town. I had already lined my stomach plenty before coming and wanted to get my alcohol on, but let me just say something first about the ambiance of this place: 

First, you're totally paying for the gorgeous 30-foot high ceilings, the cascading light display they've got next to the bar, and the quiet hush that comes when people are trying not to think about how much money they're eating. Second, I want to design my dream home's bathrooms after their bathrooms here. Minimalist Zen. 

FYI - you can't sit in the booths or at the tables without ordering some food. I like how they set up a lounge area but it's still quite tiny and when we left around at around 10:30 on Friday, it had gotten quite crowded. One $10 mojito was good enough for me. Heard good things about the magenta Setting Sun drink. Our waitress was so nice - she offered to split our six-party bill before we asked.

Free Chinese lesson of the day: the little character they have on top of ""TEN"" means sky or heaven. You're welcome. Feel free to impress your date with that.",1420,1602,view review
Vivian C.,21/03/13,5,5,6,3,"Ten is okay. Ten is fine. Ten is a so-called fancy dining establishment downtown that has pretty ridiculous prices. It could be a good reason for girls to dress up and gossip. But if you're looking for a big hearty meal respectable of your money's sweat and tears, turn around. 

I agree with most of my fellow Yelpers here, sushi quality is not anything out of this world. 

Coming here with a possible love interest is nice, on group dates though? Not so much.  

My date and I ordered off a special dinner menu, which provided the option of a three course meal for $30 each. Every dish presented was supplied with a quantity suitable for a baby. These appetizers and entrées were also on the original menu, but because they put it on a separate sheet of laminated paper and deemed it as an ""exclusive offer,"" they could legitimately cut down on the portions. Sushi, again, was so-so. Where your money goes to is the aesthetics, but given, taste was not bad either, quite tender for meats. During the dinner, my boyfriend has the tendency to joke around with me, hinting at the idea of me footing the bill. I honestly don't mind, but it's ironic when he lightly hits my hand when I try to grab the check. Points for humor and chivalry. Details, ladies. 

Explanatory summary: after what was one of the most memorable nights of my life, we scurried back to our dorms where my boyfriend had to make ramen to quench the growling that persisted. Before I passed out on the bed, I heedlessly noted to myself that the food experience is what matters, good or bad. I will simply and properly feed myself the next morning instead. No harm done.",21,218,view review
Han V.,22/03/13,1,1,3,4,"Ten is without a doubt the best sushi you can find in Charlottesville! You might accidentally walk right past it the first time because there is just a small door to a stairway that leads up to the main restaurant. 

The skewers aren't worth the money in my opinion. The waygu beef skewers are cooked nicely, but the chicken can be overcooked and the portions are pretty small. For those who are looking for a non-seafood option, try  the wagyu tenderloin topped with truffled herb wasabi butter. My sister hates sushi so she chose the steak instead and it was really flavorful and tender. Other than the tenderloin, I have found their other non-sush options underwhelming. 

The sushi is very fresh here and what I really love about Ten is that they use freshly grated wasabi! I don't usually use much of the green blob that's usually served with sushi, but the fresh wasabi has a wonderfully different flavor that goes so well with the fish. They have plenty of specialty rolls which have never disappointed. My top picks include their rainbow roll, soft shell crab roll, and dragon [eel] roll. 

I think that they're sushi prices are reasonable and comparable to what you would find in D.C. Since they don't have much competition, they are probably not pressured to keep prices low. 

Service used to be awesome here--the waiters were professional and super personable. Over the years, I feel like their service has become spotty and a little inconsistent. For example, the last time I visited, our waitress was impersonal and seemed a little flustered. I don't know if she was just having a bad night or what--- but it resulted in a slightly awkward experience.

Gregg E.,10/6/13,1,2,4,5,"I've been here a couple times. Once a rare date with my wife and another for my daughter's 25th bday. My only regret is we went to Clifton Inn for one of our other daughter's 21st in February before we knew about this place. You can see my review of the other experience but there's no need to speak of it now.

Ten is lovely. Simple yet lush. Understated. The food is creative as are the drinks. The sake selection is large for a ""big city"" joint to say nothing of its peers in Cville.

My default whenever I go to a new sushi spot is the sashimi. A good sushi chef can turn this simple dishi into a opulent, decadent experience. On my first visit, my wife actually tried my sashimi. She had never eaten it before and was curious because of the presentation. She almost ate all my sashimi. 

A very good sushi chef. Very good fish. Quality ingredients and quality chefs mean this isn't a cheap sushi joint. But what you get is excellent and a value.

Beyond the sushi and sashimi, Chef has a varied menu with great daily specials and imaginative creations that will please purists to fusionistas.

But it's not a place - as you can see from some of the reviews - for hipster hopefuls with limited budgets hoping to cop the air of sophistication without truly appreciating or understanding (or affording) what they're doing. It's not a raucous party spot and it's not really good for loud parties.

It's tranquil and interesting. I look forward to many more visits.",44,10,view review
Kathleen F.,24/08/14,,,,3,"So for my husband and I's 7 year anniversary we decided to try 10. We got to restaurant around 6pm on a Saturday. We were asked if we had reservation which we didn't, so since we didn't we were told the only seating was at bar in back or sushi bar, half the restaurant was available. Which I understand the seating might have been reserved but they remained available through the next hour of us being there. There is also no saying reservations required on door to restaurant or web site. 

The staff was friendly and food was good, place is stylish and fun.  We will probably go back with a reservation but they should have walk in seating available even 1 booth and and stand alone table would be sufficient for most couples/groups that walk in, to have no available seating when obviously there is bc they are empty is rude. I can understand if it were completely packed and 2 tables remained open but there were 6 stand alone 2 seat tables and 2 booths vacant the entire time we were there. We left at 7:13pm",17,3,view review
Daniel D.,9/12/14,,,,5,"If you like sushi and your stuck in middle of nowhere Virginia, this is a good place to visit. 

Visited this place in November with a couple of friends after having a Sushi craving.  We ordered a variety of dishes ranging from appetizers to desserts and the overall experience was good. 

Appetizers: Tried a Ten salad, it was ok, and not worth the 10 dollars. 
Main dish:  Initially I tried different sushi rolls and did not see the value.  Very expensive and were just ok.  After starting to doubt that this place was any good, I got to try Tuna Sushi and this was worth every cent.  Fish was very fresh and of very high quality. 
Desserts: Delicious, the three of us ordered different desserts and all of them were delicious.  Portion size is just right.

Throughout the experience the service was just OK, slow, but the food makes up for it.

Overall, I recommend this restaurant for people looking for the best Sushi in town.  If you do go here dont waste time and money on the sushi rolls, go for the sashimi or nigiri.",401,164,view review
Claire S.,30/08/15,,,2,4,"We ordered the Chesapeake roll, chicken skewer trio, poke don, tempura avocado, and udon soup. Everything was great except the yuzu chicken skewer tasted like soap. The other 2 skewers were great. 

Other than that the service was great, atmosphere was beautiful inside and out. Definitely recommend.",7,3,view review
Brooks C.,9/12/15,1,,3,5,"Ten is one of the best Sushi experiences that I have had in Charlottesville! It is located in a prime part of the town filled with good places to enjoy great food, alcoholic beverages, and of course entertainment.

Since it is located right on the mall off of 2nd Street, parking is a breeze since you can park in the Water Street garage or the Water Street lot. A short two minute walk and vola! Sushi!

The appearance of the inside of the restaurant is very sleek and modern; very inviting and intriguing. In the evening time, it is nice and dark (not too dark, just the perfect brightness level, if you can imagine that). I have taken my lady out here on numerous occasions (she is a sushi lover as well), and she feels the atmosphere and design is romantic, and I have to agree with her.

It features a full bar, booths, tables for larger parties, and small tables as well - perfect for that one-on-one date kind of scenario. 

Each and every time I have had the pleasure of dining here, the staff has been absolutely outstanding. Think polite and professional, and then go up Ten (see what I did there?!) levels from that! Absolutely outstanding! 

In the front of the restaurant, you get to see the sushi chef and his trainee hard at work. Art unfolds in front of your eyes, as fish, other ingredients, and their mouth watering sushi rice all come together to make the perfect concoction of sushi your tastebuds will ever get the opportunity to taste.

The waiters and waitresses are extremely knowledgeable about the menu. You can enter totally clueless in the world of sushi, and leave a walking sushi-pedia of delicious knowledge.

I have literally tried every type of sushi that they have on their menu, and not once have I ever been disappointed. They really are masters of their craft.

Usually when I review restaurants, price can play a factor in determining the overall rating of the establishment. However in this case, it is sushi - for quality sushi you shouldn't expect to get it for cheap or any sort of bargain price. Ten is not a cheap place to eat by any means, but the quality of the food, service, and atmosphere you will be receiving in exchange for your hard earned dollars is well worth it.

If you are looking for bargain sushi that comes no where near the quality of Ten, feel free to go to your local Asian buffet and serve up a plate of that amateur train wreck of a meal they call sushi.

Janice P.,16/08/16,1,,1,3,"Came again for another fancy date and was honestly rather disappointed with the quality of the fish this time around. Don't get me wrong, the sake (salmon) and other normal cuts of sashimi were still great, but it turns out their sushi chef opened his own restaurant on the downtown mall (Mican), and I'm not sure if the replacement has the same kind of experience with the cuts of tuna. 

Service was great, and the harami miso was still delicious, but the oh toro (very fatty tuna cut) was not the same cut as we had last year (that was melt-in-your-mouth good). I no longer can say I feel that it was worth the $8, though it was still good tuna. Just not oh toro, which made me a little sad.",103,248,view review

The tempura dishes were wonderful, avocado tempura was quite good, but our favorite was the lobster tempura.  Also had the chefs special sushi rolls, received an assortment of excellent seafood, and had some unique but great steak rolls as well.  The mixed drinks are fabulous too.  We will be back.

Christopher T.,22/07/17,,,4,1,"I don't often leave reviews. But TEN committed attempted manslaughter tonight, so I felt the need to write a small note in response. 

My wife and I booked a table for two for Restaurant Week. We were explicit on the reservation about her severe, anaphylaxis-inducing allergy to both peanuts and tree nuts. We reminded the waiter of the allergy when we arrived, and asked that every dish be checked with the chef to make sure there were no nuts. (I'm free from any such restrictions, but it's a Japanese restaurant, so of course we wanted to share, and in any event, I wasn't interested in ruining a date night by rendering myself unable to kiss my wife). 

First course arrives: beef tartare roll, and very pretty ahi tuna with avocado...and pine nuts. Not listed on the menu, but literally covering the entire dish. I called the waiter over and noted the nuts on the plate. He immediately apologized. We asked if he had actually checked dishes with the chef, and he admitted that while he might have done so for my wife's order, he didn't do so for mine. I ordered a different appetizer and he left. 

I admit, we probably should've just picked up and left at that point. We were feeling really uncertain about whether this place was taking her food allergy seriously. And no disrespect to any of my friends with intolerances to gluten or dairy (restaurants should take that shit seriously as well) but a nut allergy is life-and-death stuff. But we had this date planned, and it was already 8 pm, so we decided the best course of action was to ask to see the manager. 

A few minutes after I inquired at the host station, the manager shambles to our table. ""Hi.""  A blank stare. I thought, ok, maybe they didn't tell him what happened, and so I explained about my wife's allergy and the dish with the nuts.  More blank stare. I said, ""hey, we're not trying to get anyone in trouble, and we're not looking for a handout, we just wanna be sure you're not gonna bring anything else out of the kitchen with nuts in it. It could kill my wife."" The entire response:

""Only use nuts on the salads and that dish. You're fine. I guess I'll double check.""

We never saw him again. 

The waiter gave us a discount essentially amounting to 20% off. Which, again, I'm not here to quibble about. Too many people think one mistake by a server entitles them to a free supper. But I really just don't think this place took at all seriously their obligation to serve food that was safe for their customers. Which should be a baseline thing for any spot taking your money in exchange for a bite to eat, whether it's a greasy spoon or (in this case) an expensive fine-dining spot.  And so we won't go back, and we recommend that you skip it as well.",1,86,view review
Ashley V.,19/12/17,2,1,2,5,"I CAN'T GET OVER THIS PLACE. Like I can't stress that enough. I still think about it sometimes and could honestly cry. I was amazed from the second I stepped foot in the building. The place is simple, modern, and clean. They have a beautiful setup and bar. I love the atmosphere-- it makes you feel like a million dollars and makes you want to just spend your entire bank account there. 

For the appetizers, I ordered the udon and tiger shrimp. The udon was pretty good but just a tad on the salty side. The tiger shrimp was amazing. The sauce on those shrimp was to die for. It was also served on a bed of seaweed salad which gave it a nice touch. I ordered the wagyu beef roll and the soft shell crab roll. They were both very good. The soft shell crab roll was served in four larger rolls while the beef was in eight rolls. Although this place is on the pricier side, I genuinely believe it's worth it given the service and experience. I would definitely come back and try some of their drinks as well!",196,433,view review
Reilly S.,28/01/18,1,,1,4,"Came here for restaurant week, and I came out really on the fence about the meal. On one hand, the food was very good. Besides the ramen (which I will talk about a little below), the flavors were really great. The dishes were executed really well and the service seemed really attentive. The ambiance is great too, with a modern Japanese decor resembling the contemporary fare. For the $35 menu, I thought the portions were good (enough to satisfy your cravings, but not over-fill you) and the menu extensive enough to offer a variety of entree options. I ordered the below dishes:

Kitsune Udon: This udon were firm but chewy and grounded the soup really well. The warm broth had a light, salty, but bold umami flavor. Great appetizer portion that introduced the rest of the meal.

Abura Ramen: For my second noodle dish, I was expecting a similar broth, but Ten's take on this dish includes all of the fixings without a broth to dilute the flavor. The egg was perfectly cooked-firm whites on the outside and a glossy yolk in the middle. The pork had a great chewiness and salty flavor to complement the egg and noodles. What really stood out was the mushroom and tomago paste on the side. Incorporating these in with the noodles elevated the dish and added a creamy but light base to the ramen. The noodles themselves were very good, but still tasted a bit dry and disconnected with the dish. Even when you incorporate the pastes and the yolk, I would recommend adding a light sauce (other than the oil currently there) to round out the plate.

Nigiri Omakase: this dish was really good. The plate includes 4 nigiri hand chosen by the chef (these change daily). If you can order the Walu, this one was by far the best. The quality of each fish is spectacular and really showcased the knife, preparation, and plating skills of the chef. My only recommendation is to cut down on the amount of wasabi in each piece. I really like having the kick to balance out the butteriness of the fish, but in at least two of the pieces, the wasabi definitely took away from the delicate flavors.

Overall, I'm happy with my experience at Ten. The dishes were simple but well seasoned and executed. Ten uses really fresh ingredients, which brings out complex flavors without over thinking the dishes. Would definitely come back to try more maki rolls and modern entree items.",101,608,view review
Thuy H.,4/2/18,,1,1,5,"I'm speechless. My recent experience at Ten was incredible. From the food, atmosphere, to the service- everything was on point.

When you first enter the door, there is a staircase right in front of you (staircase to heaven filled with amazing food). The staircase is pretty long and can be difficult to walk on with heels- just a warning. Once you get upstairs, you see beautiful lights along the wall. The ambiance of this place is super classy and romantic. This place is perfect for date nights. 

My date and I ordered several things to share including: 
-Udon: The best udon I've ever had. It was so light and savory. The noodles were super soft yet chewy.  Also, my favorite thing about this dish was that it was piping hot which was great on a cold night.
-Unagi Sansho: This roll came with freshwater eel, Japanese peppercorn, and unagi sauce. It was so simple yet so delicious. The unagi was well seasoned and paired well with the peppercorn. Dip this in some soy sauce with wasabi and you've got a party in your mouth.
-Soft-shell crab roll: The roll's presentation caught my eyes. As for the taste, equally as appealing. The soft shell crab was crunchy and just the right level of saltiness. Definitely give it a try!
-Tiger Roll: It included prawns and unagi with a spicy sauce. The prawns were so meaty. This roll is worth trying! 
-Japanese Wagyu Beef Roll: MY FAVORITE. I cannot stress enough about how good this was. The beef was incredibly tender and well seasoned- it paired perfectly with the avocado. It just melted in my mouth. Oh my goodness, I still dream about this dish everyday. Just wow. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend this restaurant. It's pricey but the quality is so worth it. If you're a huge foodie like me, you'll love this place.",221,186,view review
Maria G.,1/3/18,,,,5,"From the moment I stepped up into this aesthetically pleasing area I was greeted by a beautiful and friendly young lady. I was alone, and she was sensitive to that (it's rare to dine alone these days lol), she asked me if I would prefer a table and I appreciated that (most places assume a loner wants the bar). The server was knowledgeable and attentive to my every need. He knew when to come over to my table and when to ask if I needed another drink....BTW: you will be missing out if you don't order a lychee martini.  Another man came to my table to ensure I was attended to and it felt good. The chef's recommendation for sea bass (and a salad) is what I ordered. I thought I had the best sea bass (Chilean) in Miami, but no...this place has the BEST sea bass dish. service and food both exceed 5     !! You will not be disappointed and your money will be well spent.",3,168,view review
Linda M.,17/03/18,,,2,3,"I went to Ten for a Friday night dinner date. 

Pros: Sophisticated ambiance, knowledgeable waiter, good Sake options.

Cons: Very expensive, some dishes have farm-raised fish, appetizer and dessert portion sizes do not justify the $$$. 


Ten gets an A+ for ambiance. The dim lighting, background music, upstairs location on the downtown mall, sleek grey booths, and high ceilings give the restaurant a cosmopolitan feel. The interior of the restaurant is one of the most sophisticated in Charlottesville. Perfect setting for a chic date or girls night out.

The food is very good but not outstanding. Considering the high price point of this restaurant, I expected more. Honestly, the sushi was of similar quality to other (much more affordable) Japanese restaurants that I have visited. 

For our appetizer we ordered the rock shrimp. Half of the shrimp was coated in a spicy creme sauce and the other half in a sweet wasabi sauce. I highly recommend this for an appetizer order. However, the portion size was small for a $12 order. 

We ordered four sushi rolls for dinner. The Maguro Karai Honey, Stella Blue Crab Roll, Unagi Sansho, and Ebi Tempura. Some rolls have eight pieces while others have six. The sushi was good- what you would expect from a respectable sushi restaurant - but it wasn't stellar. I assumed that the fish would be wild-caught considering the pricey menu at Ten, but the waiter informed me that the crab and shrimp were farm-raised (farm-raised fish are often raised in controversial conditions). This was disappointing. 

For dessert we ordered the green tea mochi and warm chocolate cake. I would recommend the warm chocolate cake. The vanilla ice cream compliments the warm inside of the cake. 

For drinks, I recommend getting a Sake flight and then ordering a glass of your favorite kind. Our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable about the different Sake options. I enjoyed my glass of the ""Little Lily"" Sake.",20,387,view review
Sarika P.,9/4/18,1,,1,5,"Ten is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlottesville. Throughout my 4 years in Charlottesville, I have probably been to this restaurant at least 7 times. The restaurant itself is very elegant and it is located on the Downtown mall which always opens up the opportunity of taking a night stroll after our stomachs are stuffed from the excellent food. 

Service: The staff is always incredibly friendly and super knowledgeable. They are always willing to share with you their favorite dishes and are never trying to upsell you on anything -- in fact, I remember our waitress during restaurant week actually giving us advice on what the most cost effective deals were. 

Food: I am a huge fan of their rolls -- they are always very unique, with some rolls including ingredients like jalapenos in them or even the standard components such as soft shell crab. Whatever ingredients they put in their rolls, they are always of the highest quality. Aside from rolls, some of my favorite dishes include the Wagyu tenderloin (melt in your mouth beef that is packed with flavor) and the Walu fish sashimi (also a melt in your mouth white fish). Definitely visit during restaurant week -- they have an awesome value deal that allows you to try many dishes for a much cheaper price, and you definitely leave feeling very full! 

I'll miss this place when I graduate!",31,839,view review
Mary H.,12/5/18,,,2,5,"YES. AMAZING. 

My boyfriend and his family are regulars here. He took me for the first time when I visited him in Charlottesville. Coming from the SF Bay Area where I eat tons of sushi, this was one of the best I've had. 

The lobster tempura was INCREDIBLE. SO DELICIOUS I'M TEARING UP THINKING ABOUT IT. Even though everything wasn't 5-star perfect this tempura impelled me to give Ten a full five star rating. It was THAT good.  

The rock shrimp tempura was also good but a little too heavy. 


We got the tempura shrimp sushi rolls and the crab rolls. The crab rolls were spectacular. Tasted like mini crab cakes. The shrimp tempura was again a little too heavy with the sauce. 

We got edamame for appetizer. Very good. 
The seaweed salad was also SO DELICIOUS. second favorite thing of the night after lobster tempura. Red miso s

The green tea had a very unique earthy taste that I really enjoyed. 

The service was slow to get our main dishes to us but they took the appetizers off the bill to compensate which was nice.",171,580,view review
Lena S.,9/6/18,,,2,3,"Coming from the perspective of someone from Las Vegas, accustomed to sushi there, in LA, and Japan itself, Ten is just alright. In a sense, it's not their fault, theres only so much Charlottesville restaurants can do not being immediately connected to any big cities receiving fish imports. For their means, they do a great job, the tuna always tastes fine, but I've had some others that have been chewy or fishy. They are also rather expensive because they do do the best they can to bring in fish. It is the only place I would ever go to get sushi in Charlottesville, but still couldn't bring myself to do it often. Decent cocktail selection! Love the lychee.",98,56,view review
Julianne W.,15/07/18,,1,,3,"My first restaurant in Charlottesville!! Aaaand it was just OK haha. The ambiance is lovely; really clean and modern, with high ceilings and windows. Bathrooms are nice too, which is always a big plus. 

The food I wouldn't go out of my way to come back for. Overall, everything was mediocre, and a couple dishes had added flavors that I did not care for. We ordered three courses from the Restaurant Week menu, those being the unagi don, torotaki, and shrimp rock tempura. The unagi don was definitely the worst thing we ordered; you don't really need to add much to sushi rice and well-cooked, good-quality unagi. But for some reason... they found the need to add a sort of ume seasoning in the form of furikake. It was weird. Like, the rice and thus the dish overall took on a sourer flavor that overpowered the normally fabulous, sweet taste of unagi. So that was mildly upsetting. The rock shrimp was certainly unique; it looks like tater tots, and the breading is thinner and softer. I personally prefer that, as there's more room for the actual shrimp. The torotaki was fine -- six pieces -- and tasted simple and relatively fresh. Can't say that the toro tasted special or far better than regular tuna, which is usually what I look for when I order toro. 

We also ordered three rolls -- the blue crab, the sake, and the rainbow -- and the Ten salad. The Ten salad combined some very strange vegetables, and overall I don't think they were very fresh, as some of the lettuce was way too bitter. The rolls had way too much mayo dolloped on top, which is a signal (to me) of over-Americanization of fresh, Japanese flavors that ought to be allowed to shine through on their own without being totally smothered by sauce. I also think the presentation was lacking... especially taking the classy ambiance into consideration. It was a tad messy. 

LASTLY, the wasabi was SO dulled down, and it was a weird color. And there was very little of it. 

Overall a totally lackluster experience -- though I am quite particular when it comes to Japanese food. I love the atmosphere and would maybe come back for just drinks, but no way would I recommend the place on the merit of their food alone.",42,827,view review
Christopher N.,27/07/18,,,,5,"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing atmosphere and location. 

My group came in not knowing anything -- our waitress ran us through everything,  and was incredibly pleasant to boot. We ended up going with the honey roll, the sake roll, and the wagyu beef roll, with an udon appetizer. All of our food came very promptly despite it being decently busy.

The udon came out very heavy on the salt, but the waitress provided us with hot water to dilute it almost immediately. All of the sushi was fantastic, we demolished it. Wrapped up with a triple sake tasting. I asked the bartender about sake, as I'm planning on visiting Japan this year, and he gave me an entire masterclass session about the sake brewing process, the terminology of each type of sake, and his own recommendations based on the preferences I listed. The sakes were all very interesting; worth trying even if you don't end up loving sake.

To top it all off, Ten is located right on the Downtown Mall in a well-decorated, cozy, and modern-feeling space. While it was a bit expensive (right around $70 including tax), I think it was more than worth it for the experience. 

Highly, highly recommended. I hope to come back to Ten as soon as I can to try more of their offeings.",9,121,view review

Erich R.,11/5/19,,,1,3,The quality of the food and drink was good. However the price did not feel justifiable for the small increase in quality compared to other places which also offer good Japanese food but for a much lower cost. Furthermore the portions often felt quite small. The vibe of the place is very nice as a modern fusion restaurant. Having been here twice already it's the kind of place that I think is worth going to but not necessarily so good to try to prioritize.,326,124,view review
Cristina W.,16/05/19,,,,4,"I love a good sushi spot - and must say Ten is one of the better places in C'Ville to satisfy your sushi craving.  My first interaction was for restaurant week where we tried the beef tartare roll, the hamachi, and the omakase nigiri.  Everything was excellent and fresh!   I will say however, that you do pay the primo prices for a spot like this - so just be prepared!

The other occasions that have brought me here have been for a quick bite before a show at the Paramount or Jefferson.  They do offer a happy hour, but only at the bar and lounge area, which is first come first serve.  I have enjoyed sake flights here on multiple occasions that have been refreshing and delightful.

Basically, I like Ten - it's fun and fresh though a little on the pricey side.  Great place to come ball out for a nice dinner but also a cool hang for some cocktails and munchable rolls!",313,245,view review
Philip T.,12/6/19,,,,5,"Ten rates a 10 for me! 
Ok it's a walk up an inestimable flight of stairs but it opens up into a beautiful modern expansive room with a wall of lights and a pleasant host to greet you . While most of the selections are a la carte,  the attentive wait staff help navigate you to the treasure filled tasting trove of sushi and  other delectables  not often found in many Japanese restaurants. We kicked off the meal with Wagu beef skewers which were delicious in a scallion wasabe topping. Next was the Tuna roll and 4 sushi selections. Just enough and artistically displayed on your plate.
I enjoyed the green tea to wash it all down and my brother enjoyed one of the innumerable sake selections.
Excellent and diverse bar choices.

This restaurant is Manhattan quality right here in central Virginia and the prices are justified by the extraordinary flavors & atmosphere. The restaurant and bar are beautiful and the service was superb. Our server Jack provided one of the best experiences in a long time and his recommendations were spot on. I am still thinking about the tempura calamari which had a perfectly spicy Korean sauce & all of the raw fish was of the highest quality and freshness.

Went to Ten for a date night on Friday night and scored a table without a reservation. Although the downtown mall was hopping, I think Ten gets overlooked because it is upstairs. We were seated in the back bar ""day"" themed area, but I'd recommend asking for the front section ""night"" themed area if possible. We had a great waitress and excellent service throughout the night. We came for a sushi night, but specifically because they had numerous vegetarian options. Everything was great - we got veggie tempura, avocado tempura, avocado roll, cucumber roll, and the two other vegetarian rolls (a shitake mushroom based one, and a cucumber/avocado roll with plum sauce). The plum sauce was really floral and unique. We sprung for green tea mochi for desert - it wasn't for us (first time trying it), but I think it was a good version of mochi!

The soft shell crab roll is also really crispy and pretty large in size. The Wagyu beef roll has a soft texture to it and has good seasoning. The drink menu is also pretty decent. It's definitely quality over quantity here but the experience is worth it imo. The atmosphere gives me lowkey NYC vibes. It's romantic and it's perfect for date night or a girls night out.

We ordered the
1.)Aka Dashi Miso (Red miso, tofu, nameko mushroom, and scallion) this was very good but a little salty for our taste
2.)Maguro Karai Honey Roll(tuna, scallion, spicy honey sauce) delicious!
3.)Spicy Toro Roll(chu toro, avo, pickled jalapeno, crunch, spicy sauces, tobiko.) This wasn't too spicy but had a good bite to it.
4.)Dragon Roll (fresh water eel, tamago, avocado, shisho) had avocado on top and had a drizzle of sauce over it which was sweet and made it all come together.
5.)Shitake Roll- This was very flavorful
All rolls came with Wasabi that was packed full of flavor and spice. Best Wasabi I've ever tasted!

We have never tried Sake before but tried the

Sake Flight: House Flight. ""Living Jewel"" ""Water Flower"" ""Soaring Clouds"". This was delicious and would recommend anyone try this!

Martinis:

The tempura lobster and rock shrimp are out of this world.  I was pretty much full after those.  The portions are good for sharing.  My husband has the rainbow roll and the kani roll and said both were delicious.  We also got the harmari trio.  The meat was a little chewy but the flavors were good. I also ordered the Ten salad and could have done without it.  It's huge. I did not like it.  The lettuce is fresh but it's heavy on something that just was overpowering in taste.  I don't know if it was mint or some kind of herb but I couldn't eat it.  The pineapple martini was good.  I also had a dirty martini that was good. Husband had Jack and coke.  No complaints.

Later, I asked for a tamago sushi to finish off my meal, and the tamago was ice-cold and that's how you can tell that they are really using the same frozen stuff you'd find in the sushi section in a grocery store, makes one wonder if the same goes for other things in their menu. 
The one redeeming factor was that the service was pretty good. My waitress was really sweet and made sure I had everything I needed, but the food was, for the most part, a disaster, and no amount of good service can really make up for that.",2,46,view review
Don W.,29/11/21,,,,4,"Ate here again since the pandemic... Made a reservation at 5:00 to sit at the sushi bar, which was our preference. Place filled up shortly thereafter. Sushi was very good and presentation likewise good. For a self-professed high-end sushi bar, I was expecting a bit more personal interaction when ordering Omakase, but it didn't happen. Nevertheless, a very good dining experience and good sushi.",65,,view review
Paola P.,12/12/21,1,,,5,"Came here last minute on a Saturday and was able to be seated at the bar. I encourage to make reservations in advance because you may not be as lucky to find spots at the bar. 

During the holiday season they are offering a holiday drink specialty cocktails which seemed to be an popular request of the night. 

Unfortunately, they were out of the rock shrimp tempura and hotate roll, which were both dishes I was eager to try. Must have been popular dishes so I want to go again and see what they are all about. That didn't prevent me from enjoying my meal however. 

I went ahead and ordered my udon soup, warm with a savory Japanese soy broth, and lobster tempura, covered in a sweet aioli, for my starters. For my main I ordered the soft shell crab roll which was very distinct in that I had never tried anything like it before. It's a warm roll that is served in 4 pieces. I believe the shiso, a Japanese herb, is what granted its refreshing flavor. The other roll I ordered was the tiger roll. 

The service was very quick and attentive as they understood my needs and expectations. Considering I was sitting at a bar, and lacked reservations, I was impressed.",77,12,view review

The ambiance and service is great. The quality of sushi is fantastic. The sushi combinations are unique. 

We ordered the:
Lychee Martini - 10/10 (super yummy)
Green Tea - 10/10 

Maguro Karai honey roll - 7/10 (it was very tasty just a bit too spicy for me)
Ebi Tempura - 8/10 
Stella blue crab roll - 7/10 (I don't like this roll, but my fiancé and sister rated it)
Wagyu beef roll - 10/10 (this is my absolute favorite roll here!)
Rainbow roll - 9/10
Dragon roll - 6.5/10 (this roll was disappointing because I usually really enjoy dragon rolls, but their version is bit too leafy)
Negi Toro - 9.5/10 (this is amazing)
Oh Toro sashimi - 10/10 (melt in your mouth amazing!)",126,234,view review
Isabella M.,10/1/22,1,,2,5,"TEN out of five stars, for sure! Is this why they named their restaurant so? hehe

ELEGANCE.

Imagine walking up a flight of styled stairs that lead to a dim-lighted restaurant with a sushi bar, exposing all their fresh products. Royalty, much? 

FRESHNESS.

We ordered their toro sashimi and it MELTED into your mouth. Literally the best! We then ordered several rolls: Maguro Karai honey, Ebi tempura, Stella blue crab, Wagyu beef, Rainbow, Dragon, Negi Toro. My all-time favorites I highly-suggest you to order is the Negi Toro and Wagyu Beef. If you are a sPiCy person, Maguro Karai honey will do you some justice too! My least favorite was the dragon roll as it had an odd texture. 

We also tried their lychee martini which was a perfect blend of sweetness and bitter. I do typically order this in any Japanese restaurant because I love lychee and fish combos; although, Ten had the best by-far. Normally, the bartender makes the drink TOO sweet but this person did it perfectly right.

Not only are their plates high-quality, but they also do not make you wait FOREVERRRRR. Their service is quite speedy!

Krista R.,19/01/22,,,,5,"I was hesitant to come here only because I am not a big fan of raw fish. I mustard up the courage to go and boy I was in HEAVEN. I started up my dinner with a Kyuri sakitni. It was so refreshing cucumber vodka drink. Great way to start of the palate. I then ordered the lobster roll which did not disappoint. It's not what I was expecting at first but as soon as the first bite hit my mouth I was sold. It has such a sweet and spicy taste to it. The lobster was amazing in itself. I then ordered the wagyu beef roll. Again not know what to expect but the flavors of the marinade are perfect. The beef just almost dissolves on in your mouth. The avocado and lettuce in the roll topped with the beef was exactly what I needed and didn't know it. I was seriously having an orgasm  in my mouth. I know most people would not even consider this sushi but in my book it is. I def want to come back and try more. As for the ambience it was great for a date night or outing with the girls, but the music is a tad to loud for an empty place. 10/10 highly recommend. I won't be hesitating to come here again or order again.",247,352,view review
Buddy G.,26/01/22,,,3,2,"Was very excited to finally make it here last night after hearing many times it's the only good sushi place in Cville 

The atmosphere is very cool. High end vibe for sure. Service was great. Good sake selection. 

Felt like it was going to be a great night when we sat down and started looking over the menu. 

Unfortunately the sushi itself did not live up to the promise of the restaurant design. 

It is simply not good. It's not awful. I've had worse, but nowhere near the level of what good sushi should taste like. 

The Toro tasted old and it was room temperature. Yuck. Other rolls had that ""fishy"" taste that signals the fish is too old or has not been cared for properly in the case. 

Should have seen this coming as I saw other rolls they were placing on the counter get hot beef dumped on top of them. That's a big red flag that this is more about the idea of cool sushi and not delivering actual high quality sushi. 

If you like a cool spot to come with your friends with a high end vibe this is your place. 

If you want to eat good sushi drive to Richmond. Sorry.",38,7,view review
Kirsten A.,16/03/22,,,4,3,"I was so excited to go back to Ten and write a five star review. I was kind of shocked to see the lower reviews--we went once in early 2021 and had a great time. But now I get it after coming here for my birthday dinner. 

The restaurant wasn't particularly crowded when we got there (~6:30) but definitely filled up by the time we left (~8:30). The server took a few minutes to get to us but promptly took our drink order, but that's where the promptness ended. It took about 20 minutes to get our first drinks. I ordered a sake flight and my husband ordered a beer. We also ordered some edamame. All three came out around the same time. The server came by to check on us and noticed we were low on water. He promised to refill but seemingly forgot, but came back to take our order. They were out of some of the non-sushi options we wanted to try so we decided to just do three sushi rolls: rainbow,sake, and tuna avocado. The server offered my husband another drink it was brought out before our food. When that came out I asked for a glass of sparkling wine. Our food came, we ate it, and 40 minutes later I still didn't have any sparkling wine. It was finally brought just before dessert. The server did take it off the bill, which was kind. But going the entire meal without a drink OR even water was kind of crazy for a place as high priced as Ten. They did give me a great dessert for my birthday which I appreciated but at that point the experience had been a little soured.  The sushi was decent, but not so amazing to overcome the poor service experience. I know everyone in the service industry is understaffed, but please at the very least bring me water! We probably would have ordered more if not for knowing it might take another 45 minutes to get more food or drinks. 

I might give ten another go at some point, but for my 30th next year I'll definitely choose another restaurant.",179,535,view review

Ten offers a very cozy dining experience with unique lighting and a beautiful interior that's an experience by itself.

Aubrey W.,22/04/22,,,1,5,"I've been told ever since I moved to Charlottesville that Ten is incredible, and my expectations were extremely high. Let me tell you, nothing disappointed. The ambiance was amazing, the drinks were strong and delicious, and the food was absolutely mouth watering. They operate in a small plates/ tapas style, so you can place orders at any time and they come out as soon as they are ready. We started with the Tori trio, which was three chicken skewers charred to perfection, topped with unique sauces. My favorite was the spicy honey, which was sweet with just a small kick of heat at the end of the bite. Next, we tried a few rolls: the Ebi Tempura, the Japanese Wagu Beef, and the Soft Shell Crab. All three were delicious, but I recommend the soft shell crab roll the most: the crab was crunchy and super fresh. You also have to try the Wagu Beef in some form. They serve it many ways, but it was super rich, tender, and covered in a delicious teriyaki sauce. Next, we ordered the Ten Hamachi. If you order anything here, order this. The yellowtail absolutely melts in your mouth, and is accompanied by a luxurious ponzu butter sauce. I also tried the Lychee martini, which was a delicious (very strong) play on a bar classic. Last, we got the green tea mochi for dessert. The ice cream was silky, and so addictive. Overall, this was a phenomenal experience. I would recommend getting a reservation because the location is fairly small, and Ten sushi is not one you want to miss!",168,27,view review
Victoria B.,12/5/22,,,,2,"Terrible dining experience. 
We arrived on time for our reservation. Upon arrival, the hostess informed us that our table was not available yet, and every table was occupied. So, we waited. When a party left, the hostess had to run and make multiple trips to clear all the food, wipe the table down, and set new plates. And whenever new diners would come in, she would have to stop this process to greet them. At this point, there were multiple parties standing and waiting. So after almost 30 minutes, she was able to walk us to our table. We were starving by this point, and it took almost 15 minutes to be greeted by our server. Then, our drinks took over 20 minutes to arrive. 
I am giving 2 stars because the food and drinks were decent quality, and the staff we interacted with were kind and apologetic, but the organization of this restaurant is awful. This place is a nightmare and I do not recommend it.",1,,view review

The shrimp was good and spicy and had a lot of meat to them. The sushi was mediocre, I was expecting a lot more out of the sushi but it wasn't bad. The Mochi ice cream was a great desert and refreshing.",70,6,view review
Keith N.,1/6/22,,,2,3,"This was disappointing....looks fancy and delicious but this is deceiving. We ordered four things: Ten, Rock Shrimp, Harami Trio, and the Miso Sea Bass. I'll start with the good: the sea bass was great--cooked perfectly, tasty broth. This is the reason I give it 3 stars. The shrimp was okay--not great, just average. Now for the not so good: the harami was very disappointing--it was so chewy it was difficult to eat. It might have been overcooked or just a very poor cut of meat. Either way, it was unpleasant. Finally, the ten (their signature salad) was simply gross. The greens were wilting and some had actually turned bad. We were baffled how they could serve this. We asked them to take it off the tab and they did. Everyone deserves a second chance so we might return to try something different. However, I sure hope they provide a better experience if we decide to come back.",10,45,view review
Stacy C.,3/6/22,,,1,2,"I don't understand how this place has great reviews. The fish is... fine. Not a notable quality difference from a strip mall sushi place. The menu tries to make things sound better than they really are. Chili crisp? Sounds great! Tastes bland. Eel roll with Japanese peppercorn? Sounds great! Tastes like any other eel roll I've ever had. The hamachi with ponzu butter? You can only taste butter and no other flavors (including the fish). So, mediocre food. Service was pleasant but SLOOOOOW. Waited 15 minutes for drinks, had to chase someone down for the check. One of the chefs had a shirt on that said ""I hate it here."" Could be a hipster thing but it actually seemed to capture the mood of the waitstaff. A lot of this could be forgivable in a cheap sushi joint. Absolutely inexcusable for a high end place.

The staircase leading up to the restaurant has candles set in the bricks, and there are candles at every table inside the restaurant. The lighting is low and the style is generally minimalist with a focus on the light fixtures. We split the cuttlefish tempura, maguro karai honey roll, and hotate roll. The tempura was my favorite with a lovely flavor and the perfect amount of coating. The sushi rolls were as good as any that I have tried. I would recommend Ten if you are in the mood for sushi.",674,21,view review

Nancy H.,21/10/22,,,,3,"Visited Ten on a Friday night and would definitely recommend reserving well ahead of time as the restaurant gets very busy on the weekends. My friends and I got the omakase and were impressed by the nigiri pieces. Ten is generous with size of the fish for the omakase compared to other omakase places that I have visited and the various fish that we did sample tasted fresh and buttery. We also tried the Japanese Wagyu beef roll which was alright but I don't think I would get it again. The wagyu was soft and rich but the experience eating it reminded me of a teriyaki rice bowl, I think I just prefer getting fish with my sushi and rolls. Additionally, the wagyu roll was rolled poorly and would break apart immediately when we tried to pick the pieces up with our chopsticks which made it hard to experience the flavors from the roll and the beef together. The Hotate roll was much better and rolled properly. Their lychee martini is definitely on the stronger end. I would recommend opting for the omakase / nigiri if you were to try out Ten but we were disappointed by the lack of attention regarding clean plating as one of my friend's soy sauce dish had an oily residue on it.",201,33,view review
Andy N.,17/11/22,,,2,5,"I have been DYING to try Ten for the longest time. I've always heard raving reviews, and Ten did not disappoint. From the moment I walked in to the very end, it was a surreal experience because of the kind and passionate staff, beautiful and elegant decor, location overlooking the Downtown Mall, and the food that melts in your mouth dispersing with a wide range of flavor. Our waiter took us on a historic journey and knew every tiny detail about every dish and it's history which was an unexpected highlight of the night. As for the food, every dish is unique in its own way, but the commonality of freshness that you won't get anywhere else. You can tell it has been handled with care and love. And even on the 'cheaper' dishes, they do not skimp out on the portions such as the tempura lobster and cuttlefish. The sashimi was exciting because we didn't know what we were getting but knew it was going to be delicious. It was fresh, flavorful, and gave us an opportunity to taste many different pieces that I wouldn't have ordered otherwise. My absolute favorite dish were the scallops; I had never tasted scallops like those before. You just have to go try it out and treat yourself!",229,88,view review

We each got a sake flight, both of which had three delicious sake tastings. We ended up deciding to do a follow-up glass of the Yoshi No Gawa. Finally, we had four rolls-the Spicy Toro, the Stella Blue Crab Roll, the Wasabi Roll, and the Negi Toro. Favorites were definitely the Spicy Toro (truly just amazing, not too spicy but so flavorful) and the Stella Blue Crab Roll (a very unique, but very Virginian, sushi roll).

I MIGHT have forgiven this if the food was good, but no such luck. The special ""bathed overnight in marinade then kissed with a torch"" miso sea bass was overdone to the point of being rubbery, and took twice as long as promised. The unagi/avocado roll was sickly sweet. The spicy scallop roll had no flavor other than heat.

First of all, you're more likely to walk into the restaurant next door as the entrance to the restaurant is actually up a flight of steep stairs thru a glass door.  After you've gone up, you'll be greeted into a very dimly lit & ambiance more like that of a chic bar in NYC, not what you'd expect of a Japanese sushi restaurant.  The bar area was the most impressive feature about this place.  I could barely read the menu as it was so dark (always makes me feel suspicious of restaurants that are so dimly lit).  Server was friendly.  Ordered green salad & seaweed salad both were good but sushi rolls were like the ones you'd get from a grocery store, just nicely plated.  Descriptions of the sushi on the menu do not meet the expectations.

Emily H.,23/11/23,,,,5,"This was our second time at Ten celebrating a birthday this time. We made a reservation around a month in advance for a Saturday night. For drinks we got the Tokobetsu Flight. They ran out of another flight so we got this one instead. Out of the three, our favorite was the okunomatsu. It was the lightest smoothest one on the palette. For an appetizer we got the aburi saba because we love mackerel and it was delicious! There were some seaweed it seemed like at the bottom and it really made the dish. We also got the negi toro and that was my least favorite. I wanted to have toro so thought it would be nice to get an additional piece of it but I didn't know it would be minced toro. Compared to the other dishes, it wasn't that special and I don't think I will order it again because it was kind of lacking but it was a nice change in flavor since it has seaweed. 
The main star of the show was the omakase 20 piece sashimi. It was very filling and every single piece of fish was quality. It tasted very fresh and they all had different distinct mouthfeels so it was such a wonderful tasting experience trying all the different pieces. We also ordered an additional piece of uni because it was a special occasion. We had originally ordered 2 pieces but they were running out and so we got the last piece. We love this place since we're both sushi lovers and would definitely recommend if celebrating a special occasion. Since we were celebrating a birthday, we also got gifted their warm chocolate cake and it was so delicious!!! They even had a lit candle which was adorable.",74,5,view review

Chat C.,18/10/24,,,,1,"REVIEW IS BASED ON ONLINE ORDER, the lack thereof

It's kind of sad and pathetic when you wait a few hours anticipating to order online at 5pm (opening time), but online orders via their website for any of their items say ""not available"" or ""ordering online is currently disabled. Please contact the restaurant to place the order"" and when you do, they drop your call and take 6 calls before they answer. The host said verbatim ""Sometimes we do takeout but not tonight because we are busy"". This person did not know why there is no consistency in online orders as to when it's available or when it's posted as unavailable, when asked. The answer is *never* based on looking at their social media. 

Please do not consider yourself a ""modern Japanese cuisine"" that prides themselves on being a landlocked sushi restaurants that curates fresh fish from the coast if you cannot provide your consumers the courtesy or notice that there is no online orders in advance. 

I completely that your establishment may be fully booked, but when someone as myself who usually ventures to this establishment *in person* cannot, and when my wife asks for quality sushi and she just delivered a baby but she gets disappointed, it's a shame. While this may be a one time thing for us, you just really need to do better communicating that there are no online orders before the restaurant opens. Period. This is a new experience I have learned about this establishment, and it sucks.
