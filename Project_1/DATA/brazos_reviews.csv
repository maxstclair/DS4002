1,,Schyler P.,11/11/16,2,1,3,4,"Alas, I must update my review for Brazos. I am now such a fan! I have learned that you just have to choose the right tacos. The right ones are amazing and I have still encountered some that are just okay from the last couple of times I went. I definitely still avoid the chorizo ones because I did have one that had some chorizo in it and I felt the same about those as I did the first time.

Anyways, the moment I realize that they have great tacos is when I went at breakfast. And had their tacos with GARLIC MASHED POTATOES in them. That honestly makes everything so great. Coupled with eggs and queso fresco among other ingredients, you really can't go wrong. Highly recommend any of the tacos with the mashed potatoes in them. My absolute favorite taco so far has got to be the one of the vegetarian ones. Sweet potatoes, mushrooms, and those delicious mashed potatoes all in one? Incredible. Would definitely get this over and over again!",315,103,view review
2,,Alyssa A.,11/04/17,,,1,2,"I had received catering from this place a few times before and it was pretty good. I was excited to try out the actual restaurant. 

We arrived around 630 and ordered a few tacos. I did not receive my tacos till around 730pm. An hour for a few tacos is terrible! On top of that some people at my table took about 1hr  and 20 min to receive just a few tacos. I understand that issues can happen but this was extremely inconvenient to the table and our plans for afterwards.

Service: 0 stars 

Food: 4 stars, carnitas was great

Ambience: 3 stars (casual and cute. But they turned the lights off at 8pm..and we still hadn't received some food.)

For a fast casual place, I would go for something faster. I think I'll stick to trying these tacos not at the restaurant.",385,674,view review

4,,Shelley R.,14/06/17,2,1,2,5,"Yummmm anytime you come here, there will be something you like! The staff is so patient and will explain the different options. They also have outdoor seating, and there were a few people that brought their dogs.
The breakfast tacos are my favorite, and I can't wait to go back!!",469,44,view review
5,,Bruce K.,21/08/17,13,9,15,5,"I was here before 8am and that's ""happy hour"" with a BOGO on tacos. Awesome because their tacos are twice as good when they're half off!

I chose two and they were made fresh to order. The ""I Love You So Much"" which is awesome to order, and the ""Yam and Eggs."" They were brought to my table outside (outside!) a few minutes later. Absolutely awesome tacos. The chorizo was just a little spicy and the small cubes of sweet potato were just perfectly soft. Both were delicious and very enjoyable. If I had to choose,  I'd say that I enjoyed the ILYSM just a little bit more.

Brazos is in an interesting part of Charlottesville. Trust your GPS and you'll be fine. Yes, that's a road.",23666,2220,view review
6,,Michelle W.,12/12/17,1,,1,5,"Hands down some of the best tacos I've ever had.  If you're in C'ville you have to try this place -- and if you're a student make sure you eat a ton before you graduate.

Breakfast and regular tacos are amazing-- you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  My favorite is the la tia -- creamy potato combined with meaty, spicy ground meat.  Who knew mashed potato could taste so freakin' good in a taco?  

Not necessarily the cheapest tacos but they aren't that small either - 2 or 3 will do just fine.",219,768,view review
7,,Alice M.,28/12/17,1,,3,2,"I know Charlottesville is not known for its Mexican food, but Brazos had been recommended to me by multiple people so I was excited to check it out. 

There is plenty of parking and lots of taco options, especially if you get there before 10:30AM and can order off the breakfast taco menu. 

We got the chip & dip combo platter and 4 different tacos. My watermelon margarita was pretty good and I really liked their ají verde salsa-- super spicy!! 

Now for the bad news. Our tacos didn't look appetizing, and the pork carnitas smelled a little off. It tasted old too. Neither of us could finish that taco. 

The chips & dip was also super disappointing. The guacamole tasted packaged and the queso was very bland and had a weird film on it. The chips were another letdown-- cold and broken as if they were from the bottom of a bag. I saw someone taking out the trash and it looks like they were Santitas-- aka the cheapest brand that you can get at any grocery store. 

Overall, disappointing!! I won't be back.",170,231,view review
8,,Christina D.,04/01/18,,,1,4,"Great tacos! One taco is actually really filling. They do not skimp on the fillings and the ingredients are really fresh. I got the la tia which has: picadillo beef, mashed potatoes, corn pico, white onion, queso fresco, cilantro. The mashed potatoes sounds weird but it worked really really well. I was very happy with that. 

My fiance got the philly and the FTW: Beef brisket, house-made chorizo, avocado and jack cheese. Personally, I didnt love either one but it was flavorful! 

We also shared the Whole Shebang so we were pretty full once the tacos came out. I would definitely recommend getting the chorizo! The queso is on point. Very creamy and delicious. The chorizo is on the saltier side so if you are salt cautious then get it on the side like we did. 

Had to knock one star because of the price. A little on the pricey side in my opinion. But if you are like me and only need one taco and some chips for lunch then this is a great spot!",163,51,view review
9,,Thuy H.,05/01/18,,,1,4,"Brazos always satisfies my taco cravings! It is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Charlottesville. I've been here a couple of time but my most recent visit was amazing.

Three tacos is all I need to fill me up. I got the Fish Aficionado, Guisada, and the Carnitas. My favorite was definitely the Fish Aficionado which consisted of blackened tilapia, red cabbage slaw, red onion, cilantro, and lime. The fish was cooked perfectly and was super flavorful. The Guisada was also really good. It had stewed brisket, jalapeños, and white onion. The brisket was incredibly soft and savory. As for the Carnitas, I thought it was just okay. It was kind of dry in my opinion and the flavors didn't stand out as much as the other tacos I tried that day. 

Note: You HAVE to try the salsas. There are three kinds: salsa roja, salsa verde, and el jefe. They enhance the tacos' flavors but, beware, they are spicy.",222,186,view review
10,,Anne C.,26/03/18,,,1,5,"Looking for hipster tacos? This is the place. There are plenty of parking spaces outside this taco palace tucked inside of IX park. The tacos are a little on the pricier side, but for the creative flavors, I'll cough up a few extra dollars any day. From breakfast tacos to Tex-Mex standards to fusion flavors, there's something for everyone here. 

I would recommend getting three tacos for a good sized meal. My favorites are the Pork Star (pork belly that has just the perfect amount of fattiness, paired with a refreshing watermelon pickle and must-have avocado) and Fish Aficionado (blackened tilapia with classic red turnip slices). 

Their drink menu is innovative (jalapeño margarita, anyone?), refreshing, and packed with flavor. Their guacamole is solid, and their salsas complement chips, tacos...everything nicely. 

Don't forget to enroll in their rewards program at check out because chances are you'll be back for more soon!",106,84,view review
11,,Matt D.,11/04/18,,,1,5,"By far the best taco restaurant in the area! 

I've been to Brazos multiple times with friends, and I have always had a great experience. It is located right next to the IX Art Park, so the environment is enjoyable from the moment you pull into the parking lot.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating and fast service (even when there is a long line, they typically move quickly through the orders).

My favorite item on the menu is the Pork Star! It comes with a thick slice of pork belly, fresh avocado, sweet white onion, and cilantro. It has a great balance of flavors and textures, and it's a filling portion size. Typically a good portion is an order of about 3 tacos, and I always make sure the Pork Star is one of them!

Another favorite is a special that I always get when it's available. The steak, chimichurri, and mashed potato taco is delicious and filling. I've never had a taco quite like it, as it seems like a small serving of an entree from a high-end restaurant, resting on a fluffy tortilla.  

Brazo's is a fantastic place for a meal or even a quick snack, and I would highly recommend making a visit!",38,487,view review
12,,Sarika P.,12/04/18,,,1,5,"I love Brazos!! This is a great fast-casual restaurant with ""hipster"" tacos (tacos with pretty unique ingredients such as mashed potatoes or pickled watermelon) and has a ton of outdoor seating. It's located in the IX Art Park and has a really great vibe, especially on days when it's sunny outside. 

I would caution that the wait is usually long during peak hours, so I often try to go at off-times. But I sometimes don't mind waiting in the line when I'm craving the tacos because they're just so good.

They allow you to choose between corn and flour tortillas, and I usually end up order 3 (4, if I'm hungry). Some of my favorites are: Carne Asada, Pork Star, Shady Grady, Sir Paul, and Shady Grady. 

They have a good (not a lot) of vegetarian options, but probably only a few vegan options unless you ask them to hold off on ingredients. They also have a selection of beer and drinks, and you can order chips & salsa while waiting for the tacos to be prepared!",31,839,view review
13,,Elliott W.,23/05/18,,,1,5,"What a gem. Good tacos. Great ambience. Great outdoor seating. Great coffee.

Tacos are very good but not the best I've had. That said, super friendly staff, great ambience and awesome outdoor seating area make Brazos a winner in my heart.

Highly recommended!",44,,view review
14,,Ara A.,17/07/18,,,2,4,"Came for the $2 tacos and it was ok. So the specialty tacos are not included so I got the chicken tacos and brisket. The brisket was better than the chicken. I also ordered the carne asada tacos and that was very tasty. It's not as authentic as I would have hoped but all good. Great service, lots of outdoor seating.",1106,213,view review
15,,Michael Y.,25/07/18,1,,2,3,"3.5 stars.

Brazos is your typical taco stand, with a decent selection of different toppings and combibstions, each with their own merits. 

I thought the texture of the tacos weren't great for the meat tacos. It felt really empty, the tortilla was much drier than the ingredients inside, and overall it didn't feel accessible to the mouth. Carne asada was also a big disappointment, which was a bummer.

The pork belly was nice, although the accompanying parts didn't do much to help.

One thing I really liked was the triple pickle. And I'd say  overall, the vegetarian tacos had more character, flavor, and texture to them. I'd definitely want to try more of those if given the chance.",595,1176,view review
16,,Caroline F.,17/12/18,,2,,5,best tacos in cville! Try anything with the mashed potatoes; not quite sure how they get that texture but it's very unique. I love how half the menu is breakfast (served all day). Great outdoor seating when it's warm too!,326,330,view review
17,,Eva L.,11/01/19,1,2,1,5,"Must-go-to! Located right across from one of the few Sake breweries in the United States, 

These tacos will have you drooling for more. Two to three of these wonders will content your ravenous stomach. They are amazingly fast at making the tacos. Shady Grady is one you have to try. Or any of the ones with mash potatoes. I was skeptical, but they are delicious.

For the indecisive ones:
There is a taco randomizer machine (Taco-bot) to help you with that. You can do give preferences or for the bold daredevils out there, you can do the random button. Makes it more enjoyable especially if you can't decipher from all the goodies.

On one of their weekdays, they have a $2 taco deal. Definitely an awesome place to check out and is comparable to Austin tacos (which I have heard are amazing). I'll definitely be here when I come back to Charlottesville.",388,616,view review
18,,Ryan K.,11/02/19,,,1,2,"A disappointing experience. I went on a Saturday at 2, waited in line to order for 15 minutes, and then had about a 50-minute wait for food. The waiting was not unexpected because Brazos was packed with patrons. I ordered the potato egg and cheese taco with bacon and the I willie love you taco. Both of which were served cold and were fairly bland. The bacon was also forgotten from my potato egg and cheese taco which again is not unexpected since it was both loud and busy inside. I had heard good things about Brazos, but a long wait for low-quality food is not my preference when eating out.",674,21,view review
19,,Laura G.,19/02/19,,1,2,4,"We tried this place for the first time for a late lunch yesterday. We started with the whole shebang--chips with salsa, queso (added chorizo for free!) and guac. The salsa had a nice smokiness to it and the queso was good with the chorizo but I would opt to not get it next time, it was a bit greasy. The guac was fresh but definitely needs some onions, cilantro, etc.

I got the fish aficionado taco and the solid taco. Two was definitely enough to fill me up since we got the chips. The fish taco was good and the solid taco was overpowered by the beans, I could barely taste the chicken. 

My BF had the Carne asada and pork star tacos and the FTW. He really liked them all and said the pork star taco was the best of the three.

We will definitely be back to try more.",42,2,view review
20,,Jacob S.,27/03/19,1,1,2,4,"Judging by my last visit this past weekend this is a UVA sorority hang out spot, and those sororities have found a gem. The food is decent and not overly expensive. The beer selection is pretty good, and also reasonably priced. The happy hours specials seem great, although I haven't had the chance to utilize them. There is ample parking, oh and in good weather they encourage dogs to hang out on the picnic benches outside. 

Triple pickle and many of their breakfast tacos are yummy! Their salsa bar reminds me of the places I used to go while living in San Diego (and their salsas taste good too!).

The only complaints I have are:
1. Their margaritas are super sweet, too sweet for me which is a problem when I want to have more than one.
2. The meat in the tacos is usually a bit overcooked (fish especially).",37,21,view review
21,,Ariel B.,28/03/19,2,,2,4,"Came in with a friend last week and loved the tacos!

I won't lie and call myself a taco expert (or deep lover) but I will say I enjoyed Brazos a lot. Got in right before the Saturday dinner rush and ordered three tacos. I ended up getting one breakfast taco and two other tacos. I wish I could remember the names of what I got but unfortunately I can't :( Needless to say each taco was delicious! I ended up liking the flour taco more so than the corn , since I found it to be a bit dry. I will say that in general I thought the tacos were just a bit too dry for me, but I'm no expert. 

The atmosphere itself is excellent, and the outdoor seating is so cute! Service was great, and pretty quick for how packed it ended up getting. 

Hopefully will have a chance to come in again!",365,332,view review
22,,Sanket K.,04/04/19,2,,1,5,"After spending 6 years in California and moving to the East Coast I really miss a great taco place where I can sit outdoors on a sunny day (in March!) and have a few tacos and a couple of beers!

Brazos brought back some good memories.

They have a wide selection of tacos (the classic Carnitas was my favourite) and a wide selection of vegetarian tacos as well. Plenty of seating outside implies that even on a Sunday, we were able to find a spot at 1:30 PM.

Definitely hope to be back soon.",44,2,view review
23,,Ben S.,28/04/19,1,,1,4,"Brazos is great! It's a real slice of Austin in Charlottesville. They have a great space in Ix Art park with plenty of parking and seating. Brazos boasts a deep menu with lots of vegetarian options and very reasonable prices. We received friendly service and prompt delivery of our order. All the options are really good, authentic Tex Mex tacos. The breakfast and lunch/dinner offerings are equally good. Their complimentary sauces are great as well. I recommend three tacos per person. Atmosphere is lively and would be great for a group or family.",1128,110,view review
24,,Abhaya T.,30/04/19,,,,5,"A rare treat! This venue is beautiful; the people are friendly, and by gosh, the tacos are out of this world delicious!  Brassos offers a choice of soft-shelled tacos, including my own personal favorite: an organic corn one!!
.
May I please encourage everyone to try Brazzos, and soon.
You may just fall in love with it, too.
.
My own favorite taco is . . .
the ""I Willie Love You"" 
with an organic corn tortilla AND sautéed spinach AND these incredible, incredible sautéed mushrooms that have some kind of magic sauce on them (magic mushrooms!)
.
On top of all that, they offer outdoor seating with a very relaxing patio that is surrounded by a garden and which is near the fun artwork of IX Park.

I consider Brazzos Tacos one of the very best parts of Charlottesville.

you will be transported.",6,151,view review
25,,Eric N.,05/05/19,1,1,2,3,"We went to check out Brazos to see what all the hype was about. They were out of chicken which was kind of a letdown but I guess somewhat acceptable since they were getting ready to close on a Saturday. 

I ordered the suggested three tacos (if hungry). The carne asada tacos were delicious and fish taco was pretty tasty as well. My main problem was that I left hungry. I might have ordered another taco or two but they were already closed and that would have put my bill for food over 20 dollars. I had to go to Three Notch'd and get some sliders. 

Overall the food is good but a little pricey. I do not recommend this place if you are hungry unless you don't mind spending a lot on tacos.",161,8,view review
26,,Diana C.,09/05/19,1,,,5,"Love this place! Seriously one of my favorite casual restaurants in Charlottesville. This time, I got (from left) the morning austin, la Tia,and the pork star. While you might think 2-3 tacos might not be a lot, they are actually very filling. The menu is huge - There are so many tacos to choose from and none of them have been disappointing so far. The atmosphere is great with the art park nearby. Plenty of space to sit - there's an outside seating area. Very friendly service each time. Overall very solid place to get a quick bite to eat.",88,432,view review
27,,Robert K.,18/05/19,,,,4,"Not all tacos are created equal. Find a place that does a corn tortilla right and you are a lucky duck!

Clearly some solid Texas influence here and enjoyed the margaritas, even the watermelon version, especially at happy hour. Particularly enjoyed the use of pickled red onion and a whole variety of vegetarian options. Relaxed atmosphere and was plenty busy on a random Thursday in April, even with an impending storm. Flavor, color, and easy fast-casual setup. 

Glad to see that IX Park is really turning into something, with Brazos Tacos being a solid part!",360,207,view review
28,,Valerie Y.,20/05/19,1,2,1,4,"Came to Brazos at around 11am on a Sunday, and boy was it busy! We waited in line for about 7 minutes, and waited for our tacos for an additional 20 minutes (abnormally long compared to my other visits). I ordered two of my favorite breakfast tacos, the Austin Morning and the I Love You So Much with corn tortillas. The second taco was a bit more oily than usual, but I was still able to finish it. I love the tacos and their quality but I think the long wait was definitely a con this visit.",512,486,view review

For catering and eaten there in person. I love the way you can customize everything and the quirky names on the menu give me a chuckle! Since they are in IX Park they have a hipster feel to them, particularly when you sit outside! 

They have an excellent drink menu! I tried a virgin watermelon margarita (too hot outside for me to drink!) and it was so refreshing! We had the Shebang Trey to nibble on while we waited and the queso and salsa we perfect. My fave taco was the Afishinado (tilapia), but I feel like you just can't go wrong here!",114,186,view review

33,,David T.,06/07/19,1,1,1,4,"Decided to check out Brazos Tacos and it def felt like a blast of home for us. My wife and I are both Texas natives and Brazos is (proudly) deliberately striving to emulate Texan taquerias such as Torchys, Fuzzys, etc. Like most Texas taco joints, you go in and order at the front and take a number to your table.  They offer three sauces (red, green, and avocado) to top your tacos. While ordering you have a huge menu above your head to help you decide which tacos to get. We ordered the chip salsa, queso, and guacamole sampler (the whole shebang). For tacos I got the Austin Morning egg taco and the black bean and egg El Guapo taco. Both tacos were excellent and definitely reminded me of home. The Austin morning was the better taco of the two. My wife also got the El guapo and the tres queso. 

Some additional thoughts, the food comes out super fast. Our tacos came out before our chips but the chips came out only a few minutes later. The chip app. The portion size of the chips is massive. Way bigger than needed for two people. Would easily feed three. The salsa, queso and guacamole are mostly fine but won't blow anyone away. The queso was a little plain. One other minor gripe (via my wife), is the soda machine was completely out of diet drinks and the guy at front didn't tell her that when she ordered it. 

They also offer alcoholic beverages which is nice if you are in the mood or want to chill on their nice covered patio. Ultimately, I would def recommend Brazos tacos for anyone with that itch for a solid, filling taco.",526,111,view review
34,,Krista V.,21/07/19,,,,5,"Literally ate here once a day while in town. Everything on the menu can be gluten free if you get it in a corn taco or in a cup. And you can make your own, picking a few options from a list.

36,,Troy B.,08/08/19,1,,1,4,"My son lives in Cville, so we meet him for lunch here.  He works within walking distance so it was a good place for him
It is off the beaten path a little, but GPS takes you right there. 
It has plenty of parking and some very nice outdoor seating with umbrellas, along with interior seating.
They have a diverse menu which appears to include breakfast items.
We got Philly Steak tacos and Fish afficianado.  Both were very good, but the Philly steak was a consensus winner!  They also have a one of the drink machines where you can pick a variety of coke products and I love Fanta Orange Zero.. so any place that has that is a winner.
My only comment is I couldn't afford to eat here everyday.  It is about $4.25 per taco and based on the size- I got three..  LOL!

37,,Becca M.,07/09/19,,,1,5,"Fantastic place to bring visitors and anyone who loves a great taco (aka everyone). It's a small restaurant with limited seating (some inside and some outdoors) but by far one of my favorite places to eat. It's a great spot for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Their outdoor seating shows a breastfeeding friendly sign.

The line can be long unless you time your meal during a UVA home game (because most people will be there instead of eating these delicious tacos). There are two registers and the employees go as fast as they can but when it's peak dinner or lunch time the lines can be long. But while you wait you can either look at their chalkboard menu on the wall or use a paper copy that they keep toward the front.

There are MANY options and during the week they do run specials like happy hour or half off during certain times of day. No matter what you choose you will enjoy. I know I always do. They recommend ordering an average of three tacos but you order individual tacos so you are free to mix and match and order a small snack or a full meal.",41,17,view review
38,,Jay T.,14/09/19,,,,4,"Excellent food at excellent prices! We blew into town to visit my cousin who happened to be here for work, and we needed a place to eat. Found Brazos on Yelp, and decided to try.
Parking is plentiful and free, and it's not any harder to get to than anyplace else in Charlottesville, where I think Thomas Jefferson laid out the streets by following a one-eyed cow as it wandered up and down the hills.
I got the coffee, which was quite good. Despite the fact that the menu lists both hot and iced teas, when my Darling Bride ordered hot tea, she was informed that they never have that, they never HAVE had that, and the cashier has no idea why it's even on the sign. So she had water.
I got three tacos- the Shady Grady, which has brisket and sweet potato inside, the pork carnitas, and the Tres Quesos, which is a vegetarian taco. Don't judge. All were excellent, but the best part was the pickled watermelon in the Tres Quesos.
Darling Bride got the Shady Grady, too, as well as The Solid (brisket and mashed potatoes), and a third one which I forgot to ask about because we were all so busy talking and eating. Cousin got a couple of tacos for herself and also an order of chips, salsa, and guacamole for the table. The salsa was a little thin but quite tasty, and these people really know their way around an avocado!
It was way too noisy to sit inside and actually converse, so we sat outside, where my Darling Bride nearly froze to death; a tragedy that might have been prevented if only she'd had a cup of hot tea to warm her...
For the pair of us, supper came to $33.48, including the tax and tip; not expensive, and well worth it! Definitely recommend this restaurant, unless you want hot tea.",170,125,view review
39,,William L.,01/10/19,,,1,4,"Food: We ordered the I Willie Love You, Austin Morning, Guisada, Shady Grady, Fish Aficionado, and Carne Asada Tacos all on corn tortillas. Long story short, all the tacos were delicious and the proteins were well seasoned. I loved the sprinkles of queso fresco on top and the corn tortillas were grilled on point. 

Experience: We went on a Monday around 11:45 am and it was fairly busy. Just a short wait to order and then the food came out about 10 minutes after. The place is self-service so remember to clean up after yourself! 

Value: The tacos varied in price from $3.35 to $4.25 per so I would say they were on the higher side. I'm used to street tacos for $1.75 on the West Coast, however, those were more no-frills type of tacos while Brazos Tacos are fancier so the higher price is expected.",70,29,view review

41,,Brian S.,11/10/19,2,1,1,5,"Great tacos. 

Stopped in here with a rather large group on a holiday, and they were absolutely packed. 

We got up to the register and started to order. They have a secret menu, but there's no explanation on what the tacos actually are. So, I asked. 

The girl looked at me like I spoke in a foreign language, and then gave me a snoody 'I don't know, I'm new here'. I was taken aback and didn't know what to say. After a pause of silence, she said, ""what, do you want me to go like ask someone""? I replied no, and just ordered something else. 

We sat down and waited about 45 minutes (again, they were absolutely packed. I believe it was memorial day maybe?). 

We got a variety if tacos and all were delicious. The chips and quso/guac/salsa were also great. 


Despite some hiccups,  the food was absolutely phenomenal and worth trying.",478,280,view review
42,,Diane H.,26/10/19,1,,2,5,This place was so fun! It is fast pace. So just stand a side and look at the menu. Because it's big!  The menu had tons of options.  The staff was super friendly and very helpful. They have Vegitarian and non vegitarian options. They even have breakfast tacos too! So we tried a huge variety and we were not disappointed. I was so in love with the breakfast brisket taco! So so yummy. Everything was fresh and inventive. It's great for groups too. Lots of seating. They also have local beers. We will definitely be back to try more of their delicious menu!,72,29,view review
43,,Maria N.,04/11/19,,,,2,Around $4 for each mini taco is a bit much imo for what you get. The tacos are tiny. The good - tons of taco options. The place has outdoor seating. And it's a nice place to meet up and have lunch with friends. The bad - this place is very overpriced. The portions are very small and it's not worth the price. The tables weren't cleaned off and the service is inattentive and pretty slow since they wait to hand out multiple orders at once.,286,110,view review
44,,Annalisa M.,16/11/19,,,,4,"This place is really cute and hip. I ordered three tacos: this is my Yam, potato, egg, and cheese, and the fish aficionado. All of them were pretty good (not great) since they were, unfortunately, missing flavor. I ordered a mexican Coke (made with pure cane sugar). Really yummy! I also ordered chips and queso. The queso tastes like melted American cheese rather than queso. The salsa is fine. I was still hungry after eating, so I ordered three more tacos: the woody (mushrooms), tres quesos, and I willie love you. They were all pretty terrible... I ended up throwing them out. There's so much to order but some flavors are really hit or miss. Happy to see a vegetarian menu, however. This place is also located right in the heart of Art Park, so there's a cute ice cream truck nearby and the is quick access to breweries. Not a bad deal.",192,415,view review

I'd say it takes 3-4 tacos (each $3-$4) to keep you full, so overall can be a little expensive for tacos. I tried the carnitas and tres quesos tacos. The carnitas was good but a little dry for my liking, and the tres quesos was super delicious. I also like how you can choose if you want flour or corn tortillas (I got one of each). The house margarita is yummy as well. Would come again and try different tacos because they have lots of options!",174,251,view review
46,,Debra M.,05/07/20,,,2,4,"Update - July 5 2020 - No Service - TAKE OUT ONLY

Every restaurant handles Covid differently.

This restaurant has moved to a take out only model. 

Zero service. Take out only. Clean your own table outside. No bathroom use.  You get the idea.   The only problem is that the Yelp reviews didn't reflect that so I need to leave this one because we chose Brazos based on Yelp. 

My husband and I stopped here on a road trip with our dogs.  We were looking forward to a nice lunch outside with table service and a bathroom.  

What we found was 
  1.  Dirty tables that we had to clean ourselves
  2.  An ordering website that weighs 300 lbs - they need an ap.  They don't offer another way to order.  
  3.  No bathroom use 
  4.  No plasticware offered or included with our order  ... my husband did go back to the window and asked for a fork and they gave us one. 

If you live around the corner and eat here all the time you know what to expect.  

This review is for those that are thinking of it for the first time. 

The tacos were very good ... the service I would expect from a food truck.  We would not have chosen this venue if we knew in advance there was no service or bathroom use.",4,,view review

I love how the black beans in the tacos are almost a purée so it stays in the taco well and you don't have black beans constantly falling out. I try and get different tacos each time I go because they're all so delicious. The breakfast ones are fun too because the potatoes are like smooth mashed potatoes. 

Their outdoor seating is great, with plenty of picnic tables and there is also a good amount of indoor seating. I like their number system (order inside at the counter, get a number, someone will bring your food to you) and they have good deals each day of the week!",157,26,view review
49,,Emily G.,09/09/20,,,,5,"I want to say these were the best tacos I've ever tasted UGH. 
Currently they do online ordering. We arrived a little after midday on Saturday and there was about a 40 minute wait for the tacos to be ready. There's a good amount of outdoor seating, picnic table style, outside the tacos place or around the park (no indoor seating or interaction inside Brazos). And if there is a bit of a wait you have all of Art Park to explore which is a cute yard of interesting abstract art pieces! But this wait is so worth it, even without the things to do there. 
I ordered the Philly-style taco and the Pork Star taco. both AMAZING. Mouth watering thinking about them (and I'm not usually a taco fanatic). The Philly-style taco had amazing flavor, inspired by ""philly cheesesteak"". The pork star was delicious, featuring amazing pork belly meat with a little bit of a spicy kick. 
Highly recommend this as a Charlottesville must-visit!!!",1201,293,view review

Pretty decent tacos: Philly-Style, Triple Pickle, Chimichurri Steak and Potatoes.

Disappointing tacos: Pollo Rostizado (chicken was boiled like it belonged in a grocery store chicken soup), The Bill (overly sweet), Picadillo (meat tasted cheap).",109,153,view review
51,,John B.,05/04/21,1,,3,4,"I rushed in before I was hungry because this place was closing early, but it was a holiday where many other restaurants were closed, so I can't really hold it against them. My online order was ready quickly and was brought to me curbside; they had designated parking spaces for this adjacent to a brewery with a lot of outdoor seating, but I drove elsewhere.

I came because of the large vegetarian variety in their tacos, and got three different ones. Some interesting ingredients emerged, including toasted sunflower seeds. The tortillas and beans and cheese were pretty standard, and this wasn't the height of taco artistry that I've ever seen, but I was certainly satisfied. And for being convenient and open, I was happy with them, and could still have tried more items.",4152,519,view review

Even though there were a lot of people, there is a good amount of outdoor seating or you can bring chairs or a blanket and sit in the grassy area around. We also had Mexican coke.

Our chips and queso came out quickly but the queso was really bland. Like a bland velveeta. There was a descent amount of it though.

Our tacos took longer than expected, the amount of meat in each was fine - the brisket was my favorite and one I'd order again.  The carnitas was bad. Chunks of bland pork, and one chunk was just a pure fat globule. 

I asked for some side salsa and got their spicy one, a verde that was only sort of spicy.

We were born and raised in Texas and were hoping for a really good taco place here in Charlottesville like what we were used to in Dallas, Houston and Austin. This is not it. We love to support local, family run restaurants that are not chains, but we just can't justify buying the tacos here anymore.

62,,Shrinath D.,06/04/22,,,,4,"Brazos Tacos in Charlottesville, VA (near IX Art Park) is a classic! It's perfect for vegetarians due to their large variety of tacos and ability to accommodate any modifications. However, no matter the taco, Brazos never fails to satisfy!

My favorite breakfast tacos are the I Willie Love You and Migas Taco. The I Willie Love You is made with scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, sliced avocado, roasted corn pico, and queso fresco. The Migas Taco is egg filled with tomatoes, onions, peppers, tortilla chips, and jack cheese. Both are served on tortilla of your choice.

My favorite go-to tacos are the Triple Pickle, Nacho Taco, and Sir Paul. The Triple Pickle is refried black beans, mushroom bruja, roasted pepitas, jalapeños, red onion pickles, jalapeño pickles, and pickled watermelon with lime. Trust me, I know its sounds weird, but IT IS SO GOOD! The Nacho Taco is more basic with beans, pickled jalapeños, onions, tomatoes, corn chips, and house queso. The Sir Paul is a simpler creation that's made with refried black beans, avocado, roasted corn pico, and roasted pepitas. 

Honorable mentions go to the This Is My Yam and Tres Quesos. This Is My Yam is a must try with its crisped sweet potatoes, refried black beans, sliced avocado, queso fresco, and roasted pepitas. Finally the Tres Quesos is a classic with its oaxacan cheese, manchego cheese, queso fresco, refried black beans, sliced avocado, roasted corn pico, and pickled watermelon. 

I'm super pumped to get Brazos again the next time I'm in Charlottesville!

Now the most important part is the food. Every single time I ate here the food was tasteless. The tacos are extra small. Barely any filling. The meats, doesn't matter which, are bland. 
To me it seems as a lack of passion or effort from either management or the kitchen. When you get your plate it doesn't bring any excitement, after the first bite you realize you were served disappointment. 
Hopefully they can come up with better recipes, good tasting meat and put some effort into what they serve.

I order the Triple Pickle which is SO flavorful in a wonderfully tasty way (the ingredients are so good together, perhaps my first time having a slice of watermelon on a taco). I can imagine intentionally visiting Brazos Tacos on a Taco Tuesday to eat multiple Tacos at a lower price (if an actuality).

Asada is great at 2nd, awful at Emmet. The picadillo is awful at 2nd, great at Emmet. Queso can be great at both, but can also be pretty bad.

103,,Tasha M.,26/11/23,,,,3,Came on two different occasions to try the different tacos. Tacos are ok not our favorite we did not like the tacos with potatoes since they were mashed. We did like the birria tacos and the meat was good in each just didn't like how mushy some of them were. A nice place to meet friends to enjoy a meal and some drinks.,366,137,view review

When the weather's nice, it's a great spot to sit outside.

105,,Laura S.,07/12/23,7,1,8,4,"Our first visit to this restaurant -- for a late lunch on a Wednesday in Dec around 2 pm.  We were greeted and seated quickly by the hostess.  The restaurant was quiet, with patrons at only two or three other tables.  We noticed that they also had a nice fenced-in outdoor seating area but it was closed given the cold temperatures. 

Most of the menu was Mexican street-style tacos with interesting choices for fillings, served on your choice of a small (6""? diameter) tortilla (corn, flour, or in a cup).  The menu suggested ordering 3 tacos if you're hungry; the waitress said many choose two tacos for lunch or three for dinner. 

We each ordered two tacos.  My husband preferred his choice from the vegetarian menu -- This Is My Yam ($4.00, his rating 5/5). This featured crisped yams with black beans, avocado, queso fresco, and roasted pepitas.  He also got a Carnitas taco ($4.25, 3/5), with slow-roasted pork shoulder, avocado, pickled red onion, cilantro, and lime.  He would've preferred shredded pork to the chunks served in the taco, and less pickled red onion.  My preferred taco was my Guisada ($4.75, rating 4/5), which featured slow-roasted brisket, diced onion, pickled jalapeño, and queso fresco. My second choice was the vegan The Woody ($4.20, 3/5), which had black beans, mushrooms in salsa bruja, roasted corn pico, and avocado. While I like all of the individual ingredients, it seemed to be missing something when put together. 

The restaurant also offered four salsas (two spicy) at a do-it-yourself counter. We took samples of all, but the tacos were flavorful enough without the added sauces. We would've liked if the tacos were served with an included side dish -- though a few options were offered on the menu, such as escabeche ($5), slaw ($4), or wood-grilled broccolini ($7).  The restaurant also offers some interesting drinks including aqua frescas and margaritas that we didn't try, this time. 

One final note.  Our waitress decided to sweep the floor under the tables near where we were sitting while we were still eating.  This really killed the ambiance of the restaurant for us not to mention our concerns about sanitation. (0/5)!",450,483,view review

The service was really fast and friendly. They also have happy hour everyday which is great. You get to also choose flour or corn shell for your taco. I got the carnitas and nacho taco, both were fantastic. They also have great deals on the margaritas and other drinks. A fantastic place to eat in the area!",547,50,view review
109,,C G.,10/05/24,,,,4,"Brazos Tacos is a great taco shop with innovative tacos. I rate them 5 out of 5 on my VegScale™ (my rating scale for how vegetarian-friendly a restaurant is). They have nine vegetarian tacos, three off which are vegan. My favorite tacos are the Sir Paul and the This Is My Yam. Beautifully crafted tacos. I was intrigued by the tacos that have mashed potatoes, but found that they were texturally a little bit odd. They have a nice kiddie menu and some great sides. Wonderful  and fun vibe. Service was great, too. Highly recommend.",40,,view review
110,,Joyce C.,30/05/24,,,,3,"Tacos were just okay in my opinion. This wouldn't be the first place I run to for tacos. I got the carnitas, carne asada, and fish aficionado. The best out out of the three was the carne asada, which thankfully was not dry. The carnitas was just okay. The fish aficionado was not good, too dry and not much flavor, which was really a miss for me. I also did not know that the sauces were self serve at a different table and I didn't see it until after I finished eating my tacos, so beware of that. I tried their watermelon margarita which was pretty refreshing.",254,31,view review
111,,Jim L.,01/06/24,,,,3,The place has a decent atmosphere and ingredients seemed to be fresh. But the food was a mediocre at best. The pork belly had flavor but was dry. Carnitas was just not good--chunk of pork appeared to be slowcooked in under seasoned water... guac and queso lacked something I can't grasp what.  Also the place is way overpriced.,250,250,view review

Steak and blackened chicken tacos were packed with flavor. It was a hard choice on which taco to eat last. The group raved about the pork belly taco. The specialty drinks: watermelon water and lemon lime drink was very refreshing. If you are a local, this is a great spot for families  and groups. For us visitors it met expectations. Highly recommend!",136,,view review

117,,Lena M.,30/10/24,3,,4,4,"I really loved checking this taco shop out with one of my best friend's for her birthday. We were in the Charlottesville area picking apples and needed to find a gluten-free friendly spot for her. We stumbled upon Brazos and were so happy we did.

It's located near this really charming art park. I loved the complex. There were other local businesses in the area as well as ample parking spots. There was plenty of seating options both indoors and outdoors.

You order at the front and get a number to sit wherever. We both loved how there were tons of vegetarian options that sounded really good. I ordered the this is my yam and carnitas taco on corn tortilla. They were both really delicious. My friend loved her two tacos (she also got the yam one and a different one).

I loved the coloring sheets and mugs filled with crayons near the front. There was also tons of natural lighting. The person at the cashier was really kind and helpful with the menu. When we were leaving, someone took our trays for us (even though it's a put your tray away type spot). I highly recommend checking out this spot for tasty tacos and great service.",668,1190,view review
118,,Epeeist F.,31/10/24,,,,2,"Not good.  I had several of their breakfast taco options.  First of all they use mashed potatoes which is just bizarre and gives an unpleasant texture.  My wife had several of their regular tacos and found all the meat to be lacking flavor and seasoning.  As an Austin native, they have missed the mark rather badly and fall back on strong veggies and sides to cover for the lack of skill in preparing meat or making a conventional, classic breakfast or dinner taco.  Multiple taco trucks around town provide a better experience.",6,,view review
