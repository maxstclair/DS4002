1,,Kimi S.,06/05/15,7,5,10,4,"Maybe it was the twinkling lights or the exposed brick walls or perhaps the garage door windows but I felt a welcoming warmth rush over me as soon as I walked in.

The menu was explained as small plates but most definitely NOT tapas because they were served as they came out from the kitchen and not all at once. This concept was definitely lost on me since I'm pretty sure that is exactly what tapas is...but I digress....

Everything on the menu looked absolutely fantastic so whittling down our choices was quite hard. We decided to go with (almost) ALL of the things!

Roasted beets with ricotta cheese - Nature has never tasted this good before
Roasted brussel sprouts - I'm a huge fan of brussel sprouts but I thought this was okay. The sprouts should have been roasted a bit longer to caramelize and get tender and this strongly tasted of fish sauce without any other flavor.
Scallop Crudo - A generous portion of the most tender, sweet scallops I have ever tasted. It took every bit of will in my body not to snatch all of these at once.
Grilled octopus open faced sando - The garbanzo puree on the toast was simple and delicious. I'm definitely going to be incorporating this into my sandwiches at home. That being said, the octupus was overcooked and rubbery and tasted like char. 
S'mores Bread Pudding - The most inventive bread pudding I've ever seen. I loved how all the slices tasted like brownie ends and the bruleed marshmallow was just perfection.",2041,5000,view review
2,,Shelly N.,25/02/16,,1,2,4,"Service: 5.0/5.0
Food: 3.5/5.0
Overall Experiene: 4.0/5.0

TL;DR: order the shaved salad, wood fired oysters, sweet sticky pork belly and pork shank. Could get better food else where for the price but the atmosphere and customer service made this place worthwhile. Not sure I would ever come back here though.

For those beer & wine lovers: there's an extensive menu and seasonal specials. 

We ordered the following:

Shaved salad: It always seems a little silly to me to go out and order a salad, but you can't go wrong with this salad! There's so much flavor to this salad and the combination of items was brilliant. There was a lot of dressing on the salad and I absolutely hate salad dressing but everything for this dish worked. Highly recommend this item!

Wood fired oysters: Definitely do not like oysters because of the taste and texture. But Oakhart made this work in every single way! The flavor was light and not very ""oyster"" like and there was a brilliant crunch from the crumb. This order comes with four oysters, so make sure you order according to your party size. 

Oyster Mushrooms: Mehhh. There wasn't anything particularly special about the flavor of this item for me.

Provoletta: If I did my visit over, I would definitely pass on this item. The bread for the make your own ""pizza"" is a bit too wood fired cooked for me. In addition, the bread had a lot of holes when it was baked, so there wasn't a lot of a bread filling. The provolone and goat cheese combination wasn't my favorite. 

Chicken wangz: Would not really recommend this item. The cream sauce was the same one served with the shaved salad but it did not go well with the wings to me.

Sweet & Sticky pork belly: Solid order but this wasn't the best pork belly I've ever had or something that really stands out to me. Definitely a good amount of flavor and would recommend but is not something special.

Chili lime roast shrimp pizza: My friends and I agree that this pizza tastes like any regular pizza but the difference for Oakhart social is how well the pizza was cooked. You can taste the smokiness of the pizza and the crust was fluffy yet soft. The texture and consistency were good but the flavors of the pizza was just whatever. 

Pork Shank Special: The pork fell off nicely and was cooked super well. It was delicious but I was kind of confused with the pairing of items. The pork shank was served on a pile of some sort of grains that I can't recall what it was?  There was also a yogurt cilantro to pair with the pork and I wished they stopped there. The combination of the Indian taste like grains and American meat was odd but would have been yummier without the grains. Still a solid order though!

Overall: The rustic atmosphere of brick wall, dimly lit light and excellent service made dinner very pleasant! Unfortunately, I'm not sure Oakhart Social is a place I would come to again but it was definitely a fun experience. My biggest beef with this place is probably the pairing of items - the combination just didn't work for me. There's an outside eating area that would be nice for when the weather is warmer.",56,348,view review
3,,Onvara A.,10/02/17,,,,4,"My friend and I came here for dinner and ordered the Brussels Sprouts (with Korean chilli, aioli, and crispy shallots) and the Marinated Mushrooms & Black Kale Pizza (with garlic potato cream and parmesan). 

The pizza was one of the best I've ever had! The garlic potato cream was an amazing touch. The brussels sprouts were a little disappointing though, as they were very salty. I've seen other great reviews for the brussels sprouts so I think it was just an off-night for them, but I'd recommend ordering the aioli on the side just in case. The crispy shallots on top almost made up for the saltiness though.

Service was good and they have a private parking lot right next to it! That was a major plus for me, especially since it's so hard to find street parking in the West Main area.

Also, the menu they have on their website is not completely accurate. There were a few dishes that didn't appear on the menu in the actual restaurant, but there were still plenty of delicious options.",619,41,view review
4,,Sean P.,05/03/17,,,1,5,"Dang, I like this place. 

Built out of an old three stall auto shop, this restaurant/bar doesn't try to hide it's history. I believe the original renovation was completed by a restaurant that failed. Oakhart took over and while I'm not sure on what they changed, the end results are great. The two stalls on the left still have their garage doors, but replaced with French doors connecting their dining patio. The patio makes the best of its space and stretches across all three stalls. It is lit with overhead hung oversized bulb lighting, which gives it a nice ambiance. The bar takes the space of the stall on the far right. About ten seats at the L shaped bar.

I've sat at the bar every time I've been here and it has suited me just fine. They do encourage drinking here, so if that's on your list, you'll fit right in. They have quite a large wine selection. I just tried to ignore that page of the menu!

The brussel sprouts were an awesome appetizer. I also enjoyed the crispy lamb shank tremendously. It was served on a bed of sunflower hummus, which I had to cut back on trying to stretch it with my lamb. I also tried other dishes and was not disappointed.",162,51,view review
5,,Steacy L.,01/10/17,,,,4,"Incredibly good food. Try the sweet/sour eggplant- that was a standout. The smoked oysters were delicious but a very small option. 
If you're looking for a drink, order whatever's in the slushee machine.",60,7,view review
6,,Ashley V.,03/10/17,1,1,3,3,"I came here on a weeknight after a long day of classes and was ready to feast. I heard so many good things about this establishment and have driven by several times telling myself that I needed to try the place out. The place looks so promising with their cute decor and natural lighting, but it just didn't deliver to the hype. 

I tried the mushroom grits, octopus oyster mushroom pizza, and the margherita pizza. The mushroom grits were...interesting. The grits were actually quite tasty and creamy; however the mushroom was kind of weird. It was larger, tart, and had a bitter char on it. I wasn't the biggest fan. It came with garbanzo beans that were yummy, but the whole dish had this interesting Indian flavor. For 13 dollars tho, I really don't think it was worth it. Our server recommended the octopus mushroom pizza and since it sounded different we decided to go for it. The pizza had  a good thin crust, but it was actually quite burnt so there was a slight bitter taste in each bite. Ironically, it got soggy quickly even though it was burnt. Thank god for the margherita pizza. It honestly saved the meal. It was actually so delicious and was a decent size. The basil on it was so fresh and everything was perfect. 

The biggest disappointment about this place was how everything was served ONE AT A TIME. I get it but man they really could not work with us because we were starving. They waited for us to finish each plate before presenting us with the next one. The problem was we didn't intend on sharing our plates like a tapas style meal so it was pretty annoying. I really don't think I would come back...idk maybe for drinks. Overall, I wouldn't give this place more than 3 stars just because it was pricey, the food wasn't that great, and the portions were wayyy too small.",196,433,view review
7,,James T.,09/11/17,3,,3,5,This place is great! Came here with the family and they had something for everyone. Would definitely recommend a cocktail with their crazy ice balls! The outdoor patio is great as well.,97,120,view review
8,,Angel H.,15/02/18,1,,2,5,"Came here yesterday for Valentine's Day dinner and had a fantastic time! Service was impeccable and the food quality was great. Just as a side note, reservations required a $50 deposit for Valentine's Day. 

First off, I loved the interior design and ambiance. The lighting is warm and cozy and the tables are well arranged to maximize numbers yet provide enough intimacy. The bar is not big but there's a little ""socializing area"" between the dining area and the bar where people gather and chat. I thought that was a cute design! The restaurant does get a little loud so sometimes it can get hard to hold a conversation. 

For the meal, they started us off with complimentary champagne- a nice surprise for the night. The plates are meant to be shared so they serve the dishes as soon as they come out. My boyfriend and I got the shaved salad, the hanger steak, and the ribs. 

The shaved salad was beyond amazing. I don't even know all the different vegetables and fruits they put in there, but the combination was magical. The crumbs on the top combined with the sauce give the salad such a nice crunch as well as a rich, tangy taste. Most highly recommend! 

My next favorite dish was the onion ring and ribs. The BBQ sauce and aioli sauce were so delicious! The ribs were well smoked and very meaty. The portion size was also quite large, definitely enough for two. 

The hanger steak was good, too, but did not quite match up to my expectations. It was definitely too well done and too tough for a ""medium,"" and it took a long time before we got it. The potatoes that accompanied the dish were fabulous though- crispy and well-seasoned! 

Oakhart Social is a wonderful restaurant that serves high quality, unique dishes. It is pricey, but you get what you pay for.",510,454,view review
9,,Alice M.,16/03/18,,,1,4,"This place is very good! The best way to do it is to go with a group and share so you can sample lots of different dishes. My favorite items thus far have been the shaved salad, ricotta toast, squash tortellini, and bread pudding. I am generally anti-salad so the fact that the shaved salad made it into my top dishes list shows just how good it is. 

A lot of people love the brussels sprouts here too but both times I've had them they were a bit undercooked. The catfish was prepared well but wasn't ""Nashville Hot"" as advertised. 

Overall, the quality of food here is quite high. The main reason I don't want to give 5 stars is because their cocktail menu is lacking-- it's all gins and whiskeys. I don't know why it is so hard to find good tequila cocktails in Cville! They also make you put in a credit card if you are reserving a table online, which is kind of a bummer. Still would definitely recommend checking Oakhart out for your next date night or small group dinner.",170,231,view review
10,,M. Spencer H.,15/04/18,,,,5,"We had an impeccable server. We arrived shortly before the kitchen was closing so they made sure to prioritize ordering food and were helpful in recommending selections. I recommend the tortellini, that sauce is divine. Their bramble cocktail is officially my new favorite cocktail in Charlottesville. It is light, sweet (but not overly so) and refreshing! I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu.",211,26,view review
11,,Nina U.,21/04/18,1,,4,5,"Boom. This is my kind of town and my kind of restaurant. We found parking in a little lot and stopped in a couple of bars along the way until our reservation was ready. They only had a late 8:30pm opening but it was so worth the wait. I cannot pick my favorites, they were all tastebud-awakening.

- Shaved Salad
- Grilled Octopus
- Chicken Wangz (my least fav but still delicious)
- Fried Catfish (we were so full by this point)",1060,699,view review
12,,Thuy H.,27/04/18,,,3,4,"I learned a few things from my recent experience at Oakhart Social. The biggest take-a-way I got was that this place offers a tapas style dining experience and if you aren't going to eat your meal tapas style, you probably won't enjoy it. I ate at this restaurant a while ago and everyone at my table got their own entree (no sharing at all) so we all did not have a great experience. However, when I came here recently and had a tapas style meal, it was an amazing experience! 

The server recommended everyone at the table getting 2-3 dishes to share. Sharing was a great way to try all the small dishes at this restaurant. Here are a few items we got:
-Shaved Salad: This sounded just like an ordinary salad but it was so good. Definitely one of the best salads I've ever had. Get this! 
-Wood Fire Oysters: I loved the citrus gremolata on the oysters. Also, the bacon fat really tied this dish together. 
-Roasted Beets: I'm not a big fan of beets so this dish wasn't that great for me. The beets tasted pretty bland- just boiled beets basically.
-Pate: Surprisingly, the pate was really good on the toasted, crunchy bread that it came with. I usually don't eat or like pate but it was pretty good.
-Grilled Octopus: I really liked the octopus! It had a charred flavor and the texture was nice.
-Chicken Wangz: GET THIS. I loved this dish. The chicken wings are so savory, crunchy, and just perfect. 
-Hanger Steak: The steak was super tender and flavorful. I loved the fried potatoes that came with this dish. 
-Fried Catfish: This was also one of my favorites of the meal. The catfish was moist and the breading was so crunchy. 
-Five Cheese Garlic Pizza: Very creamy and really crispy! 
-Pot de Creme: A solid dessert. The creme was smooth and indulgent. 

Overall, my dining experience was memorable. I'd highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a unique dining opportunity. If you despise tapas stye, don't come here.",222,186,view review
13,,Ilonachka N.,27/04/18,1,,3,5,"This is my new favorite restaurant at Charlottesville.

I came in on a Sunday with a few folks and absolutely LOVED the food here. I can't rave about it enough. I am vegetarian, so I stuck to the appetizers and the five cheese garlic pizza (which was phenomenal). In addition, the carrot appetizer is absolutely INSANE! I could eat five of those instead of a meal E-A-S-Y!!

Highly recommended to the community!",398,989,view review
14,,Sarika P.,01/05/18,1,,3,5,"Absolutely love this place!! It is located right next to Public Fish & Oyster (also another amazing restaurant!) and has such a great ambience. I heard that they recently renovated the restaurant to open up a bit more space, so I am hoping to go one more time before I leave Charlottesville! 

Some of my favorite dishes include: roasted beets, wood fired oysters, chicken wangz, roasted squash tortellini, hanger steak, and crispy lamb shank (YOU MUST ORDER THIS DISH).

The crispy lamb shank is probably the best dish of the restaurant, with the meat cooked perfectly well -- super juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I think the process of cooking the dish takes a while, so they limit to ordering it until 9:30 PM.

Two of my favorite drinks were the Flora and the Bramble On (both gin based), and they have a variety of great cocktails to choose from. 

Overall, a great place for a date or group dinner!",31,839,view review
15,,Clayton R.,26/06/18,,1,1,5,"A great find in a city full of great finds!

I sat at the bar in their super comfy and Uber-hip red bar chairs and was very well taken care of by the friendly bartender.

I had the Tuna Crudo as an app (pictured), which included some legumes on it as well....a first for me, but they pulled it off.  The flavors matched very well for a delicious, light appetizer.

For the meal, I took the bartenders suggestion for the pizza special, which was a work of art and also wish I unfortunately forgot to photograph in my excitement to get started.  It had pickled tomatoes, squash, onions and a delicious cheese blend to match an equally delicious crust.  Perfectly cooked and I savored every bite!

In a great food town, this place definitely rises to the top and I'll be returning next time I'm here.",152,29,view review
16,,April H.,28/07/18,1,,2,5,"My family really enjoyed our dinner here. We came on a Friday evening around 6pm, and we were seated at the bar, which has full service. My sister and I shared the chicken wangz and the margherita pizza. The chicken wings were slightly spicy with a faint mustard taste, which sounds kind of weird but was very good. The pizza was thin, crispy, and freshly made. Not overly filling, but just what you expect a margherita pizza to be. My parents shared the wedge salad, grilled octopus, and seared snapper. They thought everything was great, but they loved the octopus. Our server at the bar was attentive and pleasant. I would recommend Oakhart Social for a nice dinner with family or friends!",190,61,view review
17,,Lauren J.,09/10/18,,,1,5,"Ok my mom and I are visiting from California. We were initially going to go to the Public Oyster Bar place, but they only had bar seats and the restaurant was freeeezing. So they directed us to Oakhart Social. And omg. I'm so glad they did. Oakhart has shareable plates so you can order 2-3 things on the menu to try. My mom and I got the grilled octopus, the lamb ribs, and charred carrots and y'all. It was amazing! Such cool flavor combinations and everything was fresh. According to the menu, they also buy from local farms, which is a plus. Then we got desserts that were so delicious - s'mores bread pudding and pot du creme. Not too sweet and the perfect size. 
Good drinks too! 

If y'all are in the area you should definitely stop by! Wish I could come here more...guess I have to visit Charlottesville again!",9,223,view review
18,,Ira S.,12/11/18,,,,4,My wife and I enjoyed this restaurant.  We had many of their small plates and enjoyed all of them.  The one thing that I've noticed about restaurants with small plate menus is sometimes the choices don't really appeal to me and I find myself boxed into a corner with choices.  We did enjoy what we ordered.,157,19,view review
19,,Moonraker069 -.,16/12/18,,,,5,"I can't even begin to describe the flavors... an explosive melange of flavors... from spices, vegetables, and meats and fish (if you choose them). My mouth is experiencing a culinary thrill. Wow. 

Seriously. Everything we selected was good! Where do these wonderful chefs come from??  They always show up in the most obscure places. 

I am not kidding.... you have to come here. Be patient. The crowd and line are long. But the meals are worth it!",20,1,view review
20,,Allison M.,12/02/19,1,,5,3,"Not bad overall! I think all the food was executed well, but didn't hit a 5/5 in terms of blowing me away with flavors. I do love ordering tapas style, but always struggle with getting the right amount of food. It's a bit on the pricier side as well.

We got wood fried oysters, chicken wings, brussels sprouts, and pepperoni pizza. The oysters were my favorite for sure - I wished there were more. There was a great flavor with the bacon fat and citrus-y crumble on top. The wings and sprouts were both solid, but again, not the best I've had for either, but I've developed my own personal tastes for these foods. The pizza - I came in with high expectations because people love this. There isn't much pizza I don't like and this one wasn't an exception, but I just think it could have been better.",400,498,view review
21,,Tiffany L.,19/02/19,1,,2,5,"I came here after making reservations for a party of 6 on a Saturday night. They share a small parking lot with nearby shops and the inside of the restaurant is also rather tiny. (Don't bring your kids here!) However, these small complaints paled in comparison to how delicious (and inventive) the dishes were! 

It was great having 6 of us there because it meant we got to sample a decent amount of the menu which is designed as small to medium plates to share. Everything was great but the real standouts that I'd say are MUST TRYs would be: ricotta toast, squash (yes, squash!), the lamb, and the bread pudding. Wonderful and distinct flavors and textures.

This is currently my favorite restaurant in C'ville!",1365,139,view review
22,,Craig E.,04/03/19,2,2,2,1,"My girlfriend and I were so excited to try this place, but the service and food were such a disappointment. The restaurant was completely empty when we arrived, but we were seated next to the only couple at the restaurant. We wouldn't have cared but our tables were literally a few inches apart and there were plenty of open seats everywhere else. Our waiter, Collin was subpar and didn't really wait on our table the entire night. He took our order and checked up on us once throughout the dining experience. 

For drinks, we got:

Eloquent Bastard: this smelled like soap or some kind of detergent. I had to hold my breath to drink it and it was far from good. Half of the drink was foam. 

Pineapple 22A: this tasted like straight liquor mixed with burnt pineapple juice. 


For food we got:

Beets: This was nothing special. It tasted like beets from a can. 

Squash: This was the best part of our meal and that's saying a lot. Again, nothing special. 

Octopus: Half of the octopus was burnt and completely inedible. 

Swordfish: This tasted like something you would get from the frozen aisle of the grocery store. The fish had no flavor and it was very dry. The accompanying sauce tasted like a cheap honey mustard. The garnish was pieces of bitter lettuce. 

We were so disappointed we wasted a $100 at this place. Save your money and go somewhere else with better service and food.",37,24,view review
23,,Sol A.,22/03/19,2,,1,4,"I will give them a resounding 4.5 stars for their service, the octopus, the beets, the charred carrots, and the fried chicken!.

24,,Chris N.,26/04/19,,1,,5,"This story begins, as the good ones do, with an impeccably-dressed gay man.

My wife and I are farmers and don't get out much. But somehow, the three or four times we've come here, a new and impeccably-dressed gay man has complimented my wife's outfit. I'd been previously unaware that the fashion opinions of said men carry enough weight with cishet women to inhale the light of a collapsing star, but damned if I didn't learn something new that first time. 

She was a happy lady after leaving Oakhart Social. We didn't have any children the first time we went, and now we have two. I'll leave it to your imagination/nightmares to put two and two together.

Even if all the above didn't happen, the food is still worth five stars. I never had anything here I didn't want a whole lot more of. The pizza crusts are so good, they're worth stealing out of the kitchen*. My dad - a septuagenarian who sometimes pretends to forget my name just to mess with me - never fails to recall exactly how good Oakhart's lamb shank was, and then immediately thereafter yell at me for being a livestock farmer that does not raise sheep, which is true, for the following reason:

Cousin: ""You uh... you ever gon' raise sheep?""

Me: ""We probably will. Just not yet.""

Cousin: ""Mmmhmm. When you get em... you gon' $%@! em?""

Me: ""Jesus man... not all of em.""

Full disclosure: They buy a pig loin from me every now and again, but I'd legit leave this exact same review even if they didn't. But they did, so you can eat there secure in the knowledge that a.) the food is on point, 2.) at least some of the pork they offer is helping restore riparian buffers in the Northern Neck of Virginia, and 3.) you're indirectly helping me feed the two kids I only have because I ate here a few times.

What we ordered: pizza (it was actually good), carrots (surprisingly tasty and filling), hanger steak (horrible it tasted like liver), pork and pineapple (good), and the s'mores for dessert  (good).

First, the ambiance is pretty great.  I like the painted brick.  Decor is nicely done.  

The food is meant to be shared.

Started with the shaved salad.  This vegetarian option was fresh and light.  The dressing was a perfect match to the vegetables.

Next up were the charred carrots which were charred to perfection - is that possible?  

Moving on to the artic char.  The braised cabbage made for an interesting dish.  Really liked this one.

The sausage pizza was delicious.   The crust thin.  The peppers with just enough sweetness.  

For dessert, the pot du creme hit the spot.

Our whole party was pleased.   Great spot in C'Ville.",500,287,view review
29,,Cristina W.,16/05/19,1,1,1,5,"SWEET SWEET RICOTTA TOAST, YOU ARE THE STUFF DREAMS ARE MADE OF!!!! But seriously.  I had heard that Oakhart Social was amazing, but had no idea until recently how great it was when I came here for a large group dinner.  

The place is small plates-ish style - so you can def order to share.  If you only order one thing ORDER THE RICOTTA TOAST.  It is DELIGHTFUL!  The bread is that thick cut bougie fresh toast with that oh so creamy goodness of ricotta lathered on top.  It's then served with peas on top and a light and amazing vinaigrette. YES. It's a win. You won't regret it. I promise.

The other dish that stood out to me as well was the mushroom pizza.  Amazing cheesy goodness!   Plus, got to love the fungi!  The pork steak is also quite an impressive plate - so not for the faint of heart.  Ok, but not-so-faves, stood the scallion pancake and the wood-fired oysters... 
If you come by during happy hour, there are a few food specials and the fired mushrooms are also quite delicious.

The beverages are also good to the last drop - carefully crafted they are so well thought out and truly different.  I was a big fan of the perfect perfect manhattan as well as the mezcal pineapple beauty that was recipe number 22A version of the cocktail.

But for real, my key takeaways: fab place, primo cocktails, banging food, and get. the. ricotta. toast.",313,245,view review
30,,Nick D.,17/06/19,,,,4,"For how small this city is it surprised me that it was so hard to get table. We had called multiple times and finally ended up just sitting at the bar (with full service). It was odd to me though that when we walked in there were a TON of empty seats in the main dining room which apparently were being saved for others who had made reservations beforehand, funny enough even after our full meal, those tables were still empty, oh well.

The bartender was super friendly and gave us many recommendations for different things to eat and drink.  We tried the house sausage pizza which honestly was just so-so at best. We also tried the Ricotta Toast which also was apparently is what this place is known for. It was certainly an interesting take and definitely enjoyed it.

Second time around there were three of us and we ordered the shaved salad, beer battered flounder, fried chicken, and the pork steak. 
I am not a salad person but I actually ended up being a big fan of the shaved salad. Enjoyed all the other dishes as well. The four were enough food for the three of us and we had some leftovers. 
Service was quick and friendly. Price was reasonable, about ~40 per person.

This past weekend we hosted a rehearsal dinner in the events room.  We can't say enough about manager Ben Clore.  He was wonderful to work with.  He was so helpful and flexible with helping us plan this special evening.  We had approximately 40 guest in the room,  it could have held more comfortably.  The food was so amazing!!  Our friends were commenting on how delicious the food was and how intimate
the room felt.

 Huge thank you to Ben and staff for making it a perfect night!!",4,,view review
33,,Gloria R.,04/11/19,,1,3,5,"Still thinking about our seriously delicious meal here, one week later. Service was perfect -- friendly, knowledgeable, prompt. My friend and I shared the Shaved Salad, Oyster Mushroom, Grilled Pork Steak, and deconstructed S'mores dessert. The Shaved Salad was a hit and gave us the feeling that there was a great meal ahead. I loved the crispy parmesan crumbles and salad dressing, which was creamy but tasted light. The Oyster Mushroom was so delightful we practically licked the plate clean. The Grilled Pork Steak gifted an explosion of flavors thanks to the pineapple, jalepeno, and peanut topping. My friend and I were in disbelief as we happily savored each bite. 

We were too full to properly enjoy dessert, but the chocolate was just sweet enough and not at all overpowering. Overall, a terrific experience! Worth the substantial bill. 

Atmosphere-wise, the restaurant feels warm and full but not too noisy or overcrowded. If you choose to sit outdoors, they have heat lamps and wool blankets to keep you toasty.",75,12,view review

36,,Elizabeth H.,22/11/19,,,1,5,"It's about balance right?

You run 5k to not feel bad about the dessert you ate. You order vegetables so that the pizza doesn't seem as bad shared. When I travel for work, I always look for a new spot to try and get inspired. I'm Charlottesville, I was taken to Oakhart Social @oakhartsocial; it felt like I was walking right into a local Brooklyn spot. To paint the picture the walls were full of brick, painted white, and the floors of reclaimed wood. A bit dim in the space, there was a coziness in the air.

Our Picks:
Charred Carrots
Shaved Salad
Pepperoni Pizza
Pork Steak
Squash

There is no doubt in my mind that I would come back. The food was delish (small plates meant to be shared), service great and a great fusion of flavors.

And the  margherita PIZZA. So good. The crust itself has so much flavor. They are really tasting everything to make sure their salt level is perfect. The pizza had a nice char in certain spots. Also I could taste the sauce pizza and it seemed like a really elevated tomato sauce. It was a perfect thin-crust pizza.

My husband and I enjoyed a Sunday dinner at Oakhart Social.  We really enjoyed the uniqueness of the shaved salad.  I'm sure a lot of work goes into that salad and salads always taste better when someone else makes them.  I like the contrast between the very savory fennel and the sweet apples.  I also like the crunch topping on it.  We also ordered the mushroom pizza which was better than I expected.  The creaminess of the ricotta mixed with the pesto and oyster mushrooms made for a really nice blend of flavors.

We dined at Oakhart Social in early November and sat outside in the alley.  We were glad to be able to get a table without a reservation.  I'm not sure if they have much dining inside but they do also have a covered patio and offer takeout.",2718,635,view review

My husband and I got everything to share--and ordered the shaved salad, brussels sprouts, cabbage & scallion pancake, and the fried chicken. The shaved salad was light, complex, super tasty, and unlike any salad I've ever had (in a good way!). I highly recommend it. The brussels and pancake were delicious, and surprisingly filling for a veggie dish, and the fried chicken portion was also deceivingly big. We both left dinner very stuffed, and very happy.

49,,Samantha H.,09/05/21,2,,2,5,"I was so lucky to snag a spot on Resy and experience this delightful meal. Our server informed us that the dishes were meant for sharing, so we were to order as a couple. He also gave great advice on drink choices, steering me towards the spring spritz, which was a delightful cocktail and, as he said, ""a lot of fun.""

The shaved salad received high praise online and I knew I had to have it. I love salads, and this didn't let me down. Peeled carrots and thin slices of apple and breadcrumbs(!!!) coming together with lightly dressed arugula was so texturally impressive, not to mention how well the flavors worked. I could eat the salad as a whole meal. The slivers of date brought such brightness. I kept trying to construct the ""perfect bite"" of salad with all the components, but every combination is its own treat.

I savored every bit of the tuna crudo. For me, the jalapeno was too much and overwhelmed my palate, so I only tried it with one piece. The citrusy sauce was so, so good, I was trying to sop up a good amount with every morsel of tuna. I want more.

Ramp is all the rage, so I chose the pappardelle dish over the xo carbonara which had also caught my eye. Again, a feat of flavors. Each noodle was perfectly coated in butter, and the pickled ramp were little bursts of joy. The oyster mushrooms were cooked to have nice deep flavor, and again, the textural variety was excellent, I loved the bits of walnut. 

This was a perfect early dinner meal, allowing enough time for an early evening stroll afterwards and maybe finding room for dessert. I would not come here if I was so, so hungry, because I had such good food that I wanted to be able to appreciate every bite.",210,24,view review

The food was delicious and exciting. One of the main reasons I picked this place was how fun the menu sounded. And the dishes we ordered didn't disappoint. The scallion pancake was our favorite bite of the evening. Service and staff were friendly and welcoming. Social distance among the tables outside was honored so even if I weren't vaccinated, I'd feel ok. It was, however, quite busy and crowded both indoors and outdoors.

Our server was also very helpful and the kitchen was very accommodating for my dairy free needs and prepared everything deliciously. 
The scallion pancake was probably my favorite dish of the night, it was light and almost crepe like abs had picked cucumbers and a delicious sauce on top  which were both unique and balanced. The snapper was amazing with perfectly crispy skin and had a very tasty tomato type sauce underneath. The strawberry fry pie was great as well, even though it was fried it didn't taste heavy at all and the strawberries were very fresh.

The wood fired oysters were perfectly cooked with a light seasoning and perfect amount of toasted panko. Hanger steak with chimichurri was perfectly cooked, with a light aioli that paired perfectly with the potatoes. Sausage pizza was amazing, good crunch to the crust and the sausage as fresh and tasty. Didn't even have time to take pictures we pounced on it so quickly. Finished it all off and while we are full, it's a happy full due to fresh tasty food as opposed to heavy.

76,,Julia M.,17/12/22,,,,4,"Given Oakhart Social's close proximity to UVA, I was pleasantly surprised by how the ambiance departed from the typical college town vibes. It evokes a city-like, hip atmosphere with quite some creative combination of flavors. To sample what the menu had to offer, we got a variety of dishes and shared together. 

Starting with the peach & shishito toast, we wished the toast was a bit crunchier to support the toppings. The pickled onions had a subdued flavor, which is something I prefer as it would overwhelm the milder sweetness of the peach. Although there was nothing glaringly wrong with this dish, it was the charred carrots appetizer that truly won us over. The crunchiness of the pecans paired nicely with the tenderness of the carrots. If carrots were to be overdone, the texture would be too soft. Yet this dish maintained the proper bite of a carrot while being tender. 

The fried chicken was a pleasant new rendition of a seemingly simplistic dish.  Containing a bit of Southeast Asian influence, the batter was crispy and maintained juiciness while the garnishes were an assortment of basil, mint, and cilantro. The lightness and freshness of the herbs provided a contrast to the fried chicken yet balanced in a remarkably appealing way. And while fish sauce is typically sharp and seemingly out of place with fried chicken, this rendition complemented surprisingly well. 

The trout was crispy and while the flavor profile wasn't awful, it lacked the spunk and impression that the other dishes provided. 

The desserts on the other hand fell flat and would recommend going somewhere else instead.",76,12,view review
77,,Krista R.,28/01/23,,,2,5,"First of all I can't believe I found this place so late into my stay here in Charlottesville. Highly suggest reservations because this place was packed for a Friday night. They have an outdoor tent that's heated and it looked like blankets at the table. But the tent was def warmer than inside which is where we sat. I feel like this place is a hidden gem and hardly gets suggested when asking people of good places to eat. I'm throwing Oakhart into my top 3 suggestions. We ordered several dishes and drinks. The espresso martini was prob one of the best I've found here in Cville. The hibiscus Margarita also very tasty. As for food.... We started with the shaved salad which was amazing, however it seemed over salted not sure if it was added, or the garlic parm dressing or what. It was a great mix in flavors, nice hint apples and dates. Next was the ricotta toast which was probably my favorite dish. I've been obsessing over pepper jelly lately and that was the perfect ingredient to add to this toast. The flavors balanced out so well with the ham, the jelly, the cheese, and the pear. 10/10 recommend that fish. We had the wood fire oysters which I didn't think anything special about them but my bfs absolutely loved them. Our main entree dishes I had ordered the grilled pork steak which was a perfect mix with sweet, spicy and nutty. The pineapple with the steak, and the jalapeños just OMG mouth watering good. The five cheese pizza was nothing special, my bf ordered which advised against, which we would have gotten the sausage pizza instead. Lastly we ordered dessert. The s'more bread pudding was mind blowing. I could have ordered like 4 more of those. The service was absolutely amazing, spot on with delivery of each dish one by one without long waits in between. They cleared dishes rather quickly too which I like when places do that. I def am coming back here sooner than later. 10/10 highly recommend.

This place is great for any occasion, including spilling scandalous secrets with your girlfriends or going on a first date with that guy you met from Hinge(and if that doesn't go well, at least the ABC store is right across the street). 


 Of course the food was absolutely exquisite. We started with the charred carrots, which were nicely topped off with some micro greens, sprouts to be exact(8/10). Then, we got the Hanger Steak(100/10), decorated with fingerling potatoes and chimichurri on both sides. The steak was tender and the potatoes were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Also, the dish came with this gochujang aeoli that I was practically scraping off with my fork even after I finished the food. For our last dish, we got the sausage pizza(9/10). The tomato sauce was so rich and paired well with the thin crust. With room for desserts, we got the Pear Fry Pie(8.5/10) and S'mores Bread Pudding(9/10), which were also great.

85,,Scott B.,17/03/23,1,,1,5,"This is a super-high energy atmosphere.  Loud music. Hipster vibe on Arnold-level steroids. But it all works! This is not hyperbole. I've been on this earth for 50 years and this was the best cheeseburger I've ever had. Period. My dining partner had a simple pizza and - no joke - had the same reaction. Whatever they're doing in the kitchen, keep it up!",16,,view review
86,,Ryan K.,02/04/23,,,,5,"Tasty American food! The design of the restaurant is minimalist with the feeling of eating in a garage. The chairs are even a bit uncomfortable for sitting. We split the flounder, cabbage and scallion pancake, and oysters. The style of Oakheart social is to serve the food when it's ready, so everything we ate was piping hot. The oysters were well-flavored, and we were sad that there were only 4.  The pancake was scrumptious with a delectable balance of flavors. The flounder was as tasty as it gets and the sauce was a beautiful accompaniment. Overall, I would recommend Oakheart Social, and I will likely be back.",674,21,view review
87,,Michael L.,09/04/23,,,,5,"Come to Oakhart Social if you want to reward your taste buds! Each dish comes with a distinct, flavorful bite.

The highlight for us was the fried flounder special which came highly recommended by our waitress (I believe there was tumeric, garam masala, and other herbs, covered with coriander). We felt little shame in cleaning out the dish down to the bone (I wish we had done a before and after, but here's a picture to show how much we enjoyed it!).",1,246,view review

90,,Anne S.,21/05/23,1,,1,5,"It's been a while since I was there but whenever I think about our visit, I can't wait to go back.

We sat at the bar and enjoyed great conversation with the bartender.  He was a help in selecting out dishes and as an added benefit, the chef was also in the area and gave more good advice!

Our first item was the cabbage and scallion pancake.  Bartender recommended, 100% delicious.

Next was the chef recommendation, the whole fish of the day, Thai style flavors and again, wonderful.

Nice craft beer selection, craft cocktails and wine list.  

People say that Oakhart has the best pizza in town.  Maybe on another visit",395,18,view review
91,,Mary L.,29/05/23,,,,3,"Very much on the expensive side, and in my opinion not worth it. We went here for a birthday and while the server was very nice, the way everything was explained to us was very confusing. Given how few items there are on the menu, the types (personal size pizza, burger etc) and portion sizes, it did not work very well as a family style meal. 
Everything was fine, me and my boyfriend shared the beef tartar (we have had better for cheaper). We took bites of the fried chicken (it had a weird after taste) and the pizza (it was ok, not worth the price). 
The vibe was really chill and the outdoor setting was lovely but I don't think we will be back anytime soon.",17,2,view review
92,,K W.,06/06/23,1,,1,5,"An incredible dining experience.  Server was fantastic and her recommendations were spot on.  Had the wood fired oysters and the charred carrot apps.  They were both incredible.  Grilled pork steak and seared snapper were two of the best entrees I've had.  Would order both again and again.  The special cocktail - vodka, lemon juice, ginger liqueur, blueberry thyme was so good. Definitely will return!",9,,view review

97,,Caryn K.,13/08/23,,,,5,"We came here as a large group and this was the perfect place for dinner! We ordered family style and had plenty to go around. We were a group of 7, so anything that we all wanted, we ordered two of. My favorite items were: shrimp, roasted carrots, and pizza. They had a variety of options for food, plenty of seating and the service was on point. The drink orders arrived in a timely manner and since we ordered family style, our food rolled out gradually, so that the table was not overwhelmed with plates all at one time. The drinks were also well crafted and reasonably priced.",173,127,view review

106,,Justin N.,18/10/23,,,,5,"An update for Oakhart is long overdue. It's one of my favorite restaurants in Charlottesville. I love the elevated-casual ambiance here. The indoor and outdoor spaces are nice. It's great for a date or girls night. I've tried most of the dishes here and they're amazing. The cocktails are great too. On my most recent visit with friends, I tried the espresso martini. It was good and I thought it tasted like La Colombe Vanilla Latte mixed with vodka.

My favorites dishes here are the Hanger Steak, Charred Carrots, and most recently the Roasted Broccoli. The hanger steak here is my favorite hanger steak ever. I'm glad they brought it back on my visits this past year. The charred carrots and roasted broccoli are my favorite carrots and broccoli that I've ever had. They are consistently prepared well and cooked to perfection. These dishes are must orders when I visit. The fish sauce caramel, garlic aioli, and sesame crumble for texture on the broccoli are divine.

The only dishes I haven't liked in my time coming here are the Tuna Crudo and Cabbage Scallion Pancakes. The cuts of tuna when I ordered it were just not great, and both dishes are not worth the price. With that said, I love all the other dishes here and I appreciate that a lot of thought is put into creating them.",372,109,view review
107,,Brad S.,26/10/23,,,,5,"We stumbled onto this restaurant and loved it. The menu was intriguing and different from anything else available in Charlottesville. The place was packed on a Wednesday night and we were lucky to get seats at the bar (better service). My wife and I always order plates to share, and the servings here were just the right size for that. The shaved salad with fennel, carrots, apples, and dates was extremely tasty. The beet salad with oranges and yogurt and something crunchy was delicious. The seared trout was tender and sweet, and accompanied by small potatoes in something like a cilantro-honey sauce. All of the dishes featured a variety of flavors and spices. They had a variety of craft beers, but my only complaint is that they were served in cans, not on draft. We highly recommend this place, and it deserves a much better rating than 4.3. Don't be put off by the negative reviews, they were mostly written by entitled people who think they deserved more attention. Maybe they did, but our service (from the bartender) was great. And even though the place was full, we didn't have to wait too long for any of the dishes.  Ratings on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (Excellent):  Food quality 5; Drinks 4; Service 5; Cleanliness 5; Ambience 5; Value 5;  Overall rating 5 stars!",15,,view review
108,,Katherine A.,28/10/23,,,,5,"Just dined at Oakhart Social. For 3 women, I ordered the beets, the carrots, the shaved salad, the hanger steak, the bacon pizza and the s'mores bread pudding. Every single item was delicious and perfect. For drinks I highly recommend ""A Star is Born."" This restaurant never fails to exceed expectations. Furthermore, the hostess chased us down on the sidewalk with the box of leftovers we forgot to take with us. Talk about service! We hope to be back soon.",6,5,view review
109,,Victoria B.,10/11/23,1,,1,4,"This is a fun little place. The server encouraged us to order to share, so we kept that in mind, and I'm glad because I would have missed out otherwise. The carrots and broccoli were meh to me (somewhat over- and undercooked, respectively), and I didn't love the tuna. The cocktails were solid, but the easy winner for everyone was the pizza. So well done and perfect flavors. Price wise, I think it was a little high for what we got (entrée prices for tapa sizes) but it was a satisfying meal overall.",386,228,view review
110,,Jorge I.,03/02/24,2,,2,4,"Great spot! The patio is a nice addition to their indoor dining but it was chilly in there.

111,,Jordan C.,17/02/24,,,,5,"My mother and I stopped in Charlottesville for a dinner at Oakhart Social on the way back from Virginia Beach trip. We arrived around 5:45-6pm on a Friday evening, without a reservation, and were told that there would be a wait, as it was starting to get busy. I would recommend a reservation because we waited about 30 minutes for an opening at the bar. The service was good, not great, but the staff were very friendly! The ambiance was rustic and the interior had an inviting feel about it. 

Their food is meant to be shared amongst the table and is portioned accordingly. We started with the shaved salad and beets. They were both unique dishes with nice combinations of flavors. The shaved salad had arugula, fennel, carrots, watermelon radish, fuji apples, medjool dates, crumb, and a garlic parmesan dressing. The shaved veggies were super crisp, the apples and dates added a slight sweetness, the crumbs gave it some texture, and the parmesan dressing tied all the flavors together. Overall it was a really unique, tasty slaw-like salad, would recommend! The beet dish included oranges, yogurt, pistachio, and tarragon. The beets were complimented by the oranges and the yogurt sauce gave it some tang. Next out pizzas arrived, and boy were they something! We tried the mushroom pizza first and were BLOWN away with it! The mushroom pizza has oyster and shiitake mushrooms, house-made ricotta, red sauce, and pistachio pesto. The pistachio pesto had immense flavor and paired magically with the creamy ricotta cheese. Next was the bacon pizza which had potato cream, bacon, kale, red onion, and lemon zest. This was definitely a different pizza, never had pizza with potato cream before. The potato cream had a richness to it, complimented by the smokiness of the bacon, and the slight citrus of the lemon. Overall both our pizzas were stellar and they weren't too heavy. We both agreed the  mushroom pizza was our favorite though. We ended the night with their s'mores bread pudding and certainly didn't regret it! We loved various elements of this dessert including the torched marshmallows and puppy chow. The bread pudding was a nice size and was warm when it arrived. 

All in all, we had a lovely experience here at Oakhart Social. The food was full of bold flavors, made with fresh, high quality ingredients. The service was decent, but could have been a little better. My mom ordered a coffee, which they forgot, so they took a drink off our bill. Everything we ordered we thoroughly enjoyed. The salad and beets were great starters and the pizzas were exceptional! Would recommend and will be retuning next time we are in Charlottesville.",116,6,view review
112,,Drew M.,23/02/24,,,,5,"A go-to recommendation for larger parties (6-8), vegetarians, or parties with a variety of tastes and preferences. You'll get high-minded flavors in a relatively casual setting with excellent service. Oakhart has some of the best vegetable dishes in the city (beets or charred carrots), while also offering excellent pizzas. The cocktails are creative and affordable ($13). Consistently a five star experience.",4,1,view review

The fried chicken was a standout as were the carrots; the speciality pizza with apples, bacon and honey was simply wonderful. Excellent cocktails. PARKING is frustrating. Plan ahead. I recommend just going straight to the train station lot. I'm from a large city that is known for bad traffic but I believe this small college town on a weekend night is worse!

The restaurant itself is very cute and has a great ambiance. I'd recommend the trout, fried chicken, charred carrots, shaved salad, and pork steak! Overall everything was sooo good.",13,,view review
