1,,Douglas K.,11/03/19,4,,3,5,"The best seafood I have ever had in Charlottesville. Few places get a perfect score in my book, but this place surely deserves it!

When I came here tonight, I realized that the location for the restaurant is close by to many places I visit regularly: downtown mall and central campus. However, despite having been to DOMA several times, I missed this store before deciding to come tonight. Fortunately, I decided to change things up today.

Public Fish & Oyster from the outside and inside looks like a homey, modern seafood bar. And its menu reflects this aesthetic: it has a small, but well composed menu of delectable seafood dishes. Tonight, I honestly had a hard time choosing what to eat from the many great selections on the menu. Luckily, I had some Yelp help: I went with some Clark Island oysters from the Raw Bar and the wine risotto. My friend ordered the grilled char. 

Both of us were extremely impressed with our personal dishes. My risotto was a beautiful wine stained color, and the wine gave a great tang to the dish that conplemented the mellow flavor of the mushrroms. My friend's char was perfectly cooked and seasoned excellently. 

The oysters were also super fresh!

A 5 out of 5 if there were any.",211,311,view review
2,,Cristina W.,06/10/19,1,,1,5,"One of my favorite spots in C'Ville!  Make sure you make a reservation because space is limited and it is a popular spot - and for good reason!

This place is a seafood restaurant and has fresh raw oysters available on the daily.  The chalkboard showcases the varietals and prices - they go from least to most briny top to bottom.  For us, we opt for the brinier the better!  Other menu features include the calamari appetizer, the clam chowder, and the moules frites!  Calamari app is enough to share and comes with some nice veggies.  The calamari is not excessively breaded so you can REALLY taste the squid.  The clam chowder is tasty and creamy and hits the spot, especially on cold days.  The moules frites is enough to share for sure!  The fra diavola is a nice veggie option with tomatoes and spice.  The chorizo sauce has a nice kick to it as well.  My favorite though is the thai-inspired broth with coconut milk!   

Most recently, we split the steampot and it was equally impressive.  For $36 you get a pot with steamed mussels, clams, shrimp and crab legs!  There are also potatoes and corn chunks in there as well.  Now, as much as I enjoyed this dish - i would still order the moules frites over this next time.  The variety was nice, but the flavor was less so - makes sense because it is steamed seafood gofigure :)

Dessert wise, we tried the key lime pie and the blackberry slump - which was described perfectly as a cobbler and a muffin combo.  The crust is definitely bready like a muffin!  The ice cream on top really complements the dessert.

Overall, we love coming here. The vibe is lively and can get a little loud, but it's still homey and unassuming.  The service is very attentive and super friendly.  Come check them out - you won't regret it!",313,245,view review
3,,Becca M.,07/10/20,2,,4,5,"Wow! This spot is fantastic! Despite being small it's full of life and character. The space as I mentioned is petite but there is a patio outside as well. Their is limited seating so I recommend a reservation. The space has a beautiful bar on one side and an exposed brick wall on the other. Despite a small space it still feels like you have privacy and you don't hear more than a light murmur in the background. People were dressed semi casual with some people in dark jeans and a blouse or button up. Some people were dressed in dresses but everyone looked put together but suits are not required.

The bartender recommended a cocktail for me which was light and refreshing and they were to die for. We of course got oysters (clearly an unsaid requirement) as well as their heirloom tomato appetizer. Any time you see a restaurant with heirloom tomatoes as an appetizer you know they are going to be fresh and worth-while. And nothing disappointed! Their oyster list is expansive and they all tasted fresh. I went with someone who is a very big fan of oysters and he instantly saw two types he knew he loved and wanted. Based off what he ordered our waiter made some recommendations. Which were quite a hit. 

What brought me to the restaurant was the happy hour special ... the lobster roll! They have both Maine and Connecticut style. There is no wrong way to order a lobster roll but I got Connecticut style. It was fantastic. The meat was tender and the roll was perfectly buttery and soft. My partner's meal was equally as delicious. We both agreed this was some of the best seafood we've had here in Charlottesville.

As a big ice cream fan we had to order the house made ice cream which was creamy and flavorful. We split a key lime pie which was so delicious we might have to go back just to ensure we can have another slice! It was tart and sweet wrapped up in each little bite. The graham cracker crust was buttery and really rounded it out.

Overall an excellent meal! A great spot to have a girls lunch or meal as well as an intimate date spot. The food and service were impeccable. We got great recommendations and definitely see ourselves going back. Definitely a great spot that I will definitely bring visitors to!",41,17,view review
4,,Kirsten A.,31/10/20,1,,4,5,"Can't get over how great last night's dinner was!! This is one of the best restaurants I have seen for COVID precautions. We are outside, where there were plenty of heaters and so even though it was cold we were nice and toasty. You are required to wear a mask anytime you interact with wait staff so they are protected as well as you. 

We got a dozen oysters, two of 6 different types. The VA ones were $1 off during happy hour and they were delish!! Then we also got the lobster roll, Connecticut style. The two of us shared it and man it was phenomenal. I thought we would also get another entree like the mussels or the shrimp risotto but after the lobster roll we split we were stuffed! Of course had room for dessert. The online menu wasn't entirely accurate (I had my eye on the chocolate mousse but they didn't have it) but the pumpkin pie ice cream was excellent. I can't wait to come back to try some other things, and so happy to have a place to get oysters in cville!",179,535,view review
5,,Lina J.,24/11/20,2,,4,5,"Took a few visits, but I think we've finally got why Public Fish & Oyster is so lauded with praise. 

My SO had never tried raw oysters before. The staff here did an awesome job explaining and recommending different oysters to try from their oyster bar. And hats off to their oyster shuckers - they make a beautiful plate and they do an awesome job at presenting a clean, ready-to-enjoy oyster. We went to another oyster bar the other day and there was a noticeable difference (couldn't even eat the oysters, it was still attached to the shell). I feel like this is one of the only places that I trust with raw oysters!

Every time we've visited, the staff have been exceptional. I think they are doing a great job at contactless dining with QR code menus and plenty of distance between tables. I've really enjoyed their outdoor dining experience as well - even on a cold November night, the heaters make things super cozy, and the ambiance is very chill (great for people watching...at a distance!) 

I still don't think Virginia can do crab cakes like Maryland (as a proud Marylander) but this place has the best Virginia crab cakes I've ever had. I actually like their sandwiches more than their entrees (save for the Tohoku moules frites). Their fries are divine as is the accompanying garlic aioli! 

We're definitely fans of this establishment and will definitely be back.",272,206,view review
6,,Shelley R.,31/12/20,1,,2,5,"The food and service are both great here!! I came here with a group so we tried a few different things-The calamari is terrific-as are the fried oysters!! The New England clam chowder is amazing!! The Brussels sprouts appetizer was terrific-I will definitely get that again!! The crab cake entree was perfect! Nicely browned and full of tender crab-yummm!! We also were lucky enough to get the lobster roll!! These can not be beat!! They sell out of these,so go early if you want the pleasure of having one!!

Our sever Dan was top-notch!! He explained everything and suggested a bottle of wine that we all loved!! So much that we ordered a second bottle!!  He also told us that all the desserts were made at the restaurant! We followed his suggestion and shared a few desserts-the key lime pie, and the pumpkin ice cream. They were both outstanding!!",469,44,view review
7,,Perry B.,16/03/21,,,2,5,"As usual, a great seafood experience. We had a lovely outdoor celebration socially distanced from others. It got chilly and they provided blankets in addition to the heat lamps. Recommend trying the oysters, we typically go for medium brine. Yucatán Mussels are also phenomenal. My friends also enjoyed the crab cakes. If you have a seafood craving this is definitely the right spot.",150,22,view review
8,,Tyler S.,28/04/21,,,,5,"Absolutely delicious. Make a reservation online to get sure seating. A really vibrant environment, with a chalk board of oyster options with tasting notes and locations. 

Really solid cocktail and wine selections. The Steampot was a beast... and so delicious. We also had the Mahi special-- the fish and the grits were outstanding. 

Lastly, we had the key lime pie for dessert, and it was so tasty.

Such a fantastic meal and experience all around.",100,5,view review
9,,Shontina K.,09/07/21,1,,1,5,"Make a reservation or bar options are available.  Very quaint restaurant with a southern vibe.

The Service is impeccable!! From the time I walked through the door everyone greets you with a smile. 

Alana was my waitress and suggested the crab cakes.  They were delicious!!!! Alana was amazing!  Her customer service skills were unmatched.  

The key lime pie has to be flown in from Key West!!! Best I have tasted in years! 

Kudos to the owners for having great food and an awesome team that understands the importance of customer experiences.

I will definitely be back when I return to Charlottesville for work.",219,465,view review

11,,Victoria M.,22/08/21,1,,2,5,"I absolutely love oysters!! and was so excited to check this out and it did not disappoint.

The interior has such a cute, southern vibe, and I really enjoyed its aesthetic! We sat outside, which was very nice as well. 

For drinks, we ordered their special rose and white wine of the day, which was really delicious and paired super well with our oysters. 

I loved the bread that came out in the beginning, and I'm not sure if I was just super hungry or it was just that good...

We also ordered Belgian fries with garlic aioli, which was fantastic.

Now for the main event, their oysters!!! We decided to go with one of each of theirs (see my menu picture), so it was like a ""flight"" of oysters. It went from least brine-y to most brine-y (same with the menu picture). I enjoy my oysters to be very brine-y, so I really enjoyed the latter oysters, but they were all fantastic!! Will definitely be returning!!",126,234,view review
12,,J E.,06/11/21,5,,7,5,"While staying in downtown C'ville for business, I came here for dinner on a Wednesday evening and sat at the bar. The bartender was great! Very friendly and helpful! They have a very nice menu, filled with some amazingly appetizing seafood!!

Started with a cocktail, as they have a nicely put together cocktail list... The Heck Boy was great! Made perfectly and exactly what I expected based on the description in the cocktail list. I then switched to wine, as they have an interesting wine list, mostly all the unique/boutique wines that aren't the typically popular stuff, which is a nice way to try something new that might become your new favorite. In fact, while there, I tried a French white that I let a (level 2) somm friend know about and he had just had the same wine and raved about it - good options here!

I enjoyed a nice starter salad, followed by their outstanding calamari, which was very fresh and unique, with Asian flavors and Asian style cucumbers on top. Then moved on to some shrimp cocktail, which was decent, but probably the most disappointing part of the meal (reason: The shrimp was a size, slightly 2 sizes too small for traditional , hi-end restaurant shrimp cocktail and it was pre-seasoned with Old Bay style seasoning and it was definitely pre-cooked too far ahead of time to order).

The next course was the entrée! Butter poached halibut (which I got just ""the for the halubit!"") - OUTSTANDING! The carrot puree that is was sitting on top of was great! The sunchokes were interesting, but then again, this was my first time having sunchokes.

Last course was a Key Line Pie - AWESOME! And a glass of madeira to go with it - they paired nicely.

Overall, I really liked this visit and would definitely return! Also, highly recommend coming here for some better dining and decent seafood!",2898,94,view review
13,,Catherine X.,21/12/21,2,,3,5,"Started out with the oysters here. Because I've had a bad experience with oysters before, I was scared to try them but they were so fresh and went down very smoothly. And, since I can appreciate any restaurant that changes my opinion, I had to give Publics 5 stars for converting me from an oyster skeptic into a novice oyster snob. 

For the starters, I tried the roasted rainbow carrots and the calamari. The roasted rainbow carrots absolutely blew me away! They were creamy and the sauce was incorporated into the dish so well that every bite had flavor in it(something I would have never expected from a vegetable so simple). The calamari was pretty fresh too and not oily but a little hard to chew. Then, for the entree, we got the duo of jumbo crab cakes, which also were very fresh but a little too salty for me. Overall, loved the fresh ingredients and the cute ambience of Publics!",38,26,view review
14,,Kevin G.,11/01/22,1,,3,5,Been craving lobster rolls for a while and behold found a little place on the corner. They have hot and cold so you can have your preference. I prefer hot so I was very pleased. As you can see from pics they did not spare on the meat so much so that some fell on the floor and I didn't even notice. The jumbo peel and eat shrimp were delicious and if I had room I would have ordered another. The lobster is at market price but it is worth it without a doubt. I will be back to try other items on the menu.,486,38,view review

If you're looking for a wide variety of good seafood though, this place is really your best bet.",6,,view review
17,,Marley P.,09/02/22,,1,4,5,"Happy hour alert!!! Living in South Florida, happy hours are everywhere but here in Charlottesville they are harder to find. Especially good ones. Next time you want some good cocktails and food, head over to Public Fish and Oyster. Good strong cocktails for $7 and one dollar off oysters everyday from 4pm-6pm. My friend and I showed up at 4:15 and we were able to squeeze in because they are so busy and booked. Next time we will plan for a reservation. The oysters were fresh, sweet and perfect with a squeeze of lemon and a spoonful of mignonette. I know a lot of people like baked oysters, but try them raw too! So good. We also ordered the Connecticut style lobster roll, delicious and buttery. To go with it, we got Kentucky Mules because we both love a good bourbon. We will be back!",24,100,view review
18,,DJ L.,10/04/22,,,,5,"This was our first meal in Charlottesville from visiting this weekend and we could not have started off on the best foot.

In short, the food was fresh and incredible. Our server, Jaime was the best. Like absolute best! If you're from out of town and need a place - don't skip this place!

Get a reservation, ask for Jamie. Make sure you say hi to Nina, the hostess, and meet John behind the bar. Jamie is so personable and knows the 

Meal - We ordered the brussel sprouts and the calamari. Holy moly - best appetizers! We also got some fried oysters and crab cake sandwich. Being from Maryland, these crack cakes were delicious!

20,,Sarah S.,06/06/22,1,1,2,5,"Wow...Wow...Wow...Wowza! Hands down some of the best food I've had in the area. Not to mention their staff are amazing, their patio is fantastic, and that their happy hour is so good. Public Fish & Oyster is 5 stars all the time every time.

I was so grateful to have such understanding staff when we dined here last. I had made a reservation, but made a mistake by not booking the patio (due to health issues, I try to do most things outdoors). The staff were super understanding and went way out of their way to add an additional table on the patio so that I felt comfortable eating there. I was honestly shocked and so appreciative. I felt bad that they had to do those extra steps, but their kindness and willingness to help didn't go unnoticed. Our server was also very good at making food suggestions, and was so good at timing the meal. Top notch service

Onto the food! The oysters, OH MY GOD, the oysters! Such a selection. We were lucky enough to be able to do happy hour, so we went to town on some oysters. The descriptions were on point, and the recommendations were spot on. We moved onto the lobster roll and loved every bite (and those fries ooooeee so perfectly crispy). With the recommendation of our server, we went with the Hodgepodge, and we were so glad we did. So much seafood in such a tasty sauce. Also, do yourself a favor and order one of their whiskey drinks.

Again, just, wow!",230,344,view review
21,,Lindsey V.,08/06/22,,1,2,5,"This place is a catch, no pun intended! I've been here once before and everything was amazing. I don't remember exactly what I got besides oysters but I can say it was all great. I recently came back with my family and we were all pleased as usual. For one, we didn't have a reservation and they still managed to squeeze us in even though it was busy.

Secondly, the food was perfect! I ordered the steak frites and it was delicious. The chimichurri was a little weird looking but the taste was there. My brother got the soft shell crab and really enjoyed it, and my dad ordered the crab cake sandwhich and was extremely satisfied! They both said they'd come here again for sure. 

The service was also great, they were very friendly and attentive. The waitress was happy to answer any questions we had about the menu and even took the time to clearly explain to us which oysters were which! 

Definitely recommend if you love seafood.",105,10,view review
22,,Tim M.,25/06/22,,,2,5,"I was visiting Charlottesville for the day with my girlfriend. We decided that we wanted seafood while visiting the mountain community of Charlottesville. We found this restaurant online. It had good ratings, so we gave it a try.

I started with the New England Clam Chowder. OMG! It was so smooth...typically. I add pepper to any New England Clam Chowder. Not this one. It was perfectly seasoned and the broth was so creamy and smooth, and there were plenty of clams.

Not long after, the Steamer Pot arrived. It was steaming and very well seasoned. We had 2 small clusters of crab legs, a whole mess of clams, 8 huge shrimp, a couple of potatoes, and 1 ear of corn.

Everything tasted fresh. My meal paired well with my drink, a Bloody Mary.  The mix used in the Bloody Mary was delicious.  I tasted a pepper flavor, but almost like a lightly burnt pepper flavor that I had not tasted in other mixes. It is spiced perfectly for me - not too hot; not too mild.

There was plenty of food in this steamer pot for two. Looking back, it was a bigger bowl of New England Clam Chowder than I expected. The prices are fair for the food and service you receive. The staff are wonderful! And the bartenders are exceptionally skilled. 

At the end of our Steamer Pot, I requested a whiskey sour. I enjoy a good whiskey sour.  I am not ashamed to say, tonight I enjoyed a great whiskey sour. I don't know what he did to make that drink so smooth. It was the perfect balance of the sour mix, the whiskey, and butter. That drink was buttery smooth. 

Overall, my girlfriend and I agree that the food was delicious. Good job, cooks/chefs. The service was fantastic! Everyone was friendly and out of the way helpful.  The ambiance was nice. It was cozy inside. And the barkeeps were on their game. The drinks were amazing.

We will be returning to this hidden gem. A great dining experience.",16,6,view review
23,,Deb B.,25/06/22,2,1,1,5,"We were at first told we'd have to wait an hour. We took an Uber there. The hostess was so very nice and got us a table. Only 2 of us. We had oyster shooter and they were yummy. Our drinks were mixed very well. Good selection of spirits. My boyfriend ordered clam chowder and good lort. It's the food you eat when it winter, you don't feel good, okay anytime...it was the best clam chowder I've had since Massachusetts. We got the steamer pot and split it. Steamer pots I'm associated with at OBX are usually huge and feed 3 people. This one is smaller. I saw another couple each having their own but I couldn't eat a whole one by myself. It was so yummy. The staff, waitress and bartender we all very nice and cracking jokes. Great atmosphere.

24,,Kat Z.,04/07/22,1,,2,3,"pros: really yummy oysters, really great ambiance 

cons: our main dishes --fish of the day (seared ahi curry) and the hodgepodge -- were very lackluster. I had to ask for salt for the hodgepodge because the taste was so one-note. The sauce was missing the usually freshness of seafood. Not worth the price.",57,8,view review
25,,Wenxi H.,07/07/22,,2,2,2,"Summary: all the food LOOKS very good but TASTES bad. 

Full review: To get to the point, it seems like this place has really good ideas for food but hasn't quite gotten to the point of making it taste good. It was super busy the night we visited, but we nabbed some bar seats right as we went in.

We got a bunch of oysters that were pretty standard. The special was a ""rare ahi tuna"" that was closer to ""100% cooked for 1 cm and completely raw for the rest."" The fish actually looked really good but the texture combination of raw+cooked did not work. The curry underneath, a bog standard red thai curry, was great with the rice.

The Hodgepodge lived up to it's named and there was actually quite a lot of mussel. Unfortunately the soup base was weak and the entire bowl needed a lot of salt to bring the flavor out. The table bread that accompanied was also just a small stick of white that left a lot to be desired.",10,2,view review
26,,Eddie K.,26/07/22,1,,1,5,"A great seafood spot! Their oyster selection impressed me on my first visit last year, so this time I came back to enjoy a full meal. 

The service was great throughout the night and our server was very attentive and friendly. We ended up ordering a round of oysters and shrimp cocktail and it was just as tasty as I remembered--highly recommended for those who love a good briny set of oysters! 

*Shrimp po-boy - this was a tasty entree and wile I wouldn't say it was the best ever, it certainly hit the spot. The fries that came with it were excellent and happened to be my favorite style of fries. They also give you a ton so you'll likely leave stuffed.

*Brussels sprouts - these were really good. The sauce that these are prepared/mixed in really made these stand out from the usual Brussel sprouts from other restaurants. Would certainly order again. 

*Chicken sandwich - wife ordered this and she enjoyed her selection as well. This also came with a mountain of fries so she too, walked out of these stuffed.

Summary: great location, the vibe is right, the service is on point, and the food is good. Will come again the next trip to Charlottesville.",130,29,view review

Sat at the bar and ended up in conversation with some of the locals. Even the bartender was a plus. If i lived in the area, this would be a regular hangout. Saw some reviews about the fish being lackluster here - but the oysters had no such issue - phat and juicy on the inside, lightly breaded and crispy. the Rockefeller style was superb. Worth the trip.",709,153,view review
28,,Se C.,07/08/22,,1,,3,"Came here last night to dine in. I've been here at least 5 times now and it's clear there is quite a bit of inconsistency in both the quality of service and food. 
I made a reservation for dinner at 6 pm and they were sold out of the lobster rolls. I was a bit sad about that. I guess I just missed it bc the people that were sat next to us got lobster rolls. 
We ordered two drinks and oysters before the happy hour ended at 6 pm. Only Virginia oysters have a dollar discount during happy hour. 
I ordered their steak frites and my friend got the sockeye salmon. 
The drinks came out first naturally but the bartender who brought the drink winked at my friend making her feel uncomfortable. 
Then to my surprise, the main food came out first before the oysters. I thought the order for oysters were placed first and they are appetizers. When I inquired about why the oysters haven't come out first, the waitress said that their oysters come from all over the place so it takes a while for them to get them ready. Also, she mentioned that there is no particular order of how the food comes out. 
I was confused at that explanation. Appetizers should come out before the main? The oysters come from everywhere?? I mean, shouldn't they have the oysters in house already?? I clearly saw them at the front when I was checking in at the restaurant on a pile of ice. 
The fries during this visit was soggy and over cooked. During my previous visits, the fries were nice, crisp, and yellow. not greasy and dark looking. Perhaps the humidity had something to do with it?

I also felt like I was being looked down upon during this visit. Not sure why though. Students are on summer break so the majority of people dining in were the age group of the students' parents. We were one of the youngest diners here. Felt like I was being judged based on how I was dressed and being a younger generation who couldn't afford being here. 

I really like their lobster rolls, but I think over the years, my conclusion is that this place is a hit or miss on their service and quality of food.",722,351,view review

Our waiter was really sweet and let us sample a variety of oysters so that we could figure out which we liked best. We tried out the revivals, beavertails, and wellfleets. The wellfleets were our favorites so we ordered a half dozen more! We also tried the steak frites which was amazing. I would say that the fries were a little too crisp and hard for my liking but the rest of it was great. I would definitely come back for a date night!",56,5,view review

Danny and Zoe were amazing and engaging. Danny made me feel like this was my old hangout. I ordered the hh oysters which were good my only drawback was the horseradish didn't have enough kick. 

I was lucky enough to score one of their lobster rolls and it was amazing on top of that I was given the option of salad or fries. I chose the salad to eat while there and it was huge with field greens. 

To finish out and take back to my hotel I took the fries and asparagus. The aoli that comes with the fries was garlicky in a great way and I even dipped a piece of asparagus in to try. 

Hands down I will be back.",73,57,view review

I would argue that the crab, lobster and oysters are the freshest seafood you can get in Virginia unless you are near the coast.

The indoor seating is pretty but cramped. The outdoor seating is nice on good days when there's no tent up but I don't love the heated tent unless you're worried about covid then it's perfect.

There's always a good selection of oysters to suite every taste, and they're very fresh. They're a little bit pricey, but that's ok. There are three styles of mussels on the menu and they all are excellent. The Steampot contains a nice variety of seafood, and also is excellent. Very good cocktail and beer list too.",85,10,view review

We found plenty of street parking near by and the ambience was perfect for oysters. Our server was extremely helpful and efficient. We started with a dozen oysters.

42,,Brian T.,12/04/23,,,1,5,"I was in Charlottesville for a little getaway last week, and Public Fish and Oyster was on my short list of places to dine. I have to tell you, it was absolutely the best time I've had sitting at a bar eating in a very long time. The food was outstanding, but the atmosphere and the people around me made it even better. Sitting there at happy hour (great deals to be had...a dollar off oysters on the half shell? Yes, please!) enjoying a ""Fisherman's Breakfast"" (a Narragansett and an oyster shooter) carrying on with a wonderfully boisterous insurance salesman, a lawyer and his wife, and my bartender/server Danny and having just the best damn time.

Everything was top tier....very busy, but service never lacked at all. The food was fabulous....my oysters were tasty as could be, and the lobster roll (Connecticut style....warmed and buttered on a toasted buttered roll) was fabulous, and the garlic aoli sauce that was served with the fries was outstanding. I'm already planning a return trip to C-Ville, and I'll be returning to Public Fish and Oyster as well.",30,,view review

During Happy Hour 4-6pm they serve lobster rolls for $32, either Maine (cold w/mayonnaise) or Connecticut (warm w/butter) style on a soft roll with fries or salad.

Oysters Rockefeller, calamari, crab cakes. All made with GF panko as a standard as well as so much more. I always enjoy fresh, grilled etc seafood options. Was nice to enjoy something a little different. Fresh Herb & Butter oysters were delish. We found the restaurant last minute and we're not able to get reservations, but they were able to get us in immediately on the patio. Great atmosphere. Service felt a bit rushed. And was slightly disappointed that with so many Gf options for apps and dinner that the only dessert option was ice cream. Wouldn't stop me from going back.

I make it a point to travel through Charlottesville so I get the pleasure of eating here. Oysters are fresh and a fantastic selection. The scallops are to die for. Recently I had the pleasure of eating their PEI mussels I've eaten them in PEI and actually prefer the ones here. Had them classic style with a butter cream sauce with garlic thyme and onions. Absolutely heavenly balanced out by delicious fries. Do yourself a favor and give them a try.,32,,view review

My partner had scallops and the were also delicious.  My only issue was with drink service.  I ordered a whiskey sour (Makers) and it was served in a champagne glass with no ice?  Weird..

58,,Stephanie B.,17/10/23,1,,1,5,"I love Public Fish! My partner and I dine here most days after a hike in SNP. We usually arrive during happy hour and take advantage of the specials including the oyster shooters and lobster rolls. Now I am not the biggest Bloody Mary person but this place has THE BEST bloody mix! It's house made and always taste great every time. I like to get my oyster shots virgin so I can get full flavor of the mix/oyster. The clam chowder is perfect for a chilly day. It's hearty, creamy and has plenty of clams veggies. The chilled lobster roll is my go to. It's light and the bun is not too buttery so doesn't give you a weighed down feeling. My guy usually gets something different each time, lobster roll, crab cake sandwich, fish special, etc. I can't recall the special for this past Sunday but he thoroughly enjoyed it. The service is always on point here as well. I definitely suggest dining here, just make sure to have a reservation as they fill up quickly and the bar stays busy so don't count on that for seating unless you arrive close to opening time!",62,5,view review

It was so good that I wanted to drink the leftover sauce.  The crabcake and Oyster sandwiches were also delicious.  I would definitely come here again the next time we are in town and order from the raw bar.",77,6,view review
60,,Jenna K.,30/10/23,,,,4,"We came this past weekend as a birthday celebration during their happy hour! We first ordered all of their raw oysters on the half shell. The staff kindly arranged them from least to most briney. They were all so fresh and delicious! To drink, one of us got a Brexit (haha), which was strong and so refreshing. Additionally, we got two oysters shooters, which, if you love Bloody Mary's, these would be right up your alley!

As an appetizer, we ordered the corn ""ribs,"" which were amazing. Surprisingly, they were our favorite food all night! For mains, we got the sea scallops and the PFO pot roast. They were both so delicious! The scallops were five pleasantly plump and seared to perfection with a nice refreshing corn salsa. The pot roast was superb and creamy and so delicious!

The location was super nice. It was nicely decorated, and their patio was very pretty. Our server was super helpful and checked on us all night. He did a great job!

Our one con was: we were sitting outside, and the pitcher of water they were pouring into the cups was filled with small bugs since they left the pitcher outside. It happened several times to us. It was a very small issue, though!

Staff started cleaning and mopping about 45 mins before the 9PM closing; we were still sampling the dessert. I could see our waiter lounging around in the kitchen area after he unceremoniously dropped a check before we finished.

Service - borderline rude.  The woman that waited on us was not in the mood to be at work that night.  A lot of sighing.  Never returned to our table.  We finally had to send the manager to find her after getting our food and, after 15 minutes, she had still not checked with the table.  At the end of the night, as we were leaving, I said, ""Thanks,"" and she just looked at me.  Not the warm, fuzzy feeling that we've gotten in the past.

Food - Not great, like in the past.  The calamari was swimming in ?soy sauce?  and the clam chowder was 85% potatoes.  The shrimp po-boy was tasty, though.  Drinks were good.  

Ambiance - okay.  The open but covered room was mostly large groups so that was super noisy.  The main room was the same as usual, just tight.

The oil cake, a subtle lemon and smooth (?oil) texture/ very nice.

They had a pretty big list and they had descriptions about them which was helpful. I went with two different kinds that I ended up loving so made a note for the future. We shared a lobster roll which was good and it came with fries that were excellent. We also shared a crab cake sandwich. It was very thin and crispy. It was a very different texture than I'm used to and no lump meat but it was still good. The salad on the side was very fresh and I liked the house dressing. I'll go back.,945,125,view review

On the topic of bars, the cocktail menu is extensive, and the bar is well stocked if the cocktails on the menu are not what you desire.

After listening to our server's recommendation we ended up getting 10 northern belles, 10 katama bay, 4 southern something (seems like the menu changes throughout the day since checking now a couple hours later it is different). The quality is amazing. I would also recommend asking the server which oysters are big/juicy that day (katama bay were the biggest today) before deciding which to order. Everything tastes extremely fresh and the meat is plump. Super delicious, a must get especially for oyster lovers. 
We also got the fresh Maine lobster rolls (Maine style) with salad. If we hadn't gotten fries earlier in the day we would've ordered it with fries which looked crispy and delicious. Finally, we also got a New England clam chowder which was pretty good. 
The march hare mocktail was also pretty good! We asked which was the sweetest and the server recommended the first two. It tasted good, like juice and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommend this place especially if you like happy hours and seafood. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly.",74,5,view review

104,,Antonia C.,15/09/24,,,,4,"Very good food and service. It's a little small and snug inside, so if you are sitting inside, particularly in the middle row of the restaurant it can get awkward cause people are literally standing right over your table while waiting for a table or near the bar for a drink. Other than that, the food is incredible, out waitress was sweet and personable.",8,13,view review
105,,Jeff L.,17/09/24,,,,4,Great food. Of course this type of fresh fish doesn't come cheap shipped in fresh from New England but it's better to pay more than less for poor quality. Busy on the weekend so go during the week or 5:00 pm on the weekend.,7,,view review

107,,Pilar G.,11/10/24,,,,5,"One of the best restaurants in Charlottesville and by far the best happy hour! 

Public has outstanding service and a great ambiance both inside and outside. The severs here always go above and beyond and have impressive knowledge of the menu. 

Food wise, you can't make a bad choice here. This time, we enjoyed the happy hour selection of oysters and a Maine style lobster roll. I also had a nonalcoholic version of an Aperol spritz that was surprisingly delicious! Everything here was fantastic and the seafood is very very fresh!",187,133,view review
108,,William F.,13/10/24,,,,5,"I've never had a bad meal here. John is incredible as a host/server. We went off script on our normal orders last night and John guided us through. 
Oysters were fresh as always and the halibut on special was incredible. I know this sounds weird but the broccolini on the side was perfect. 
My favorite old fashioned in town as well.
I truly believe this is the best restaurant in C'ville.",13,567,view review

John, the bartender/host was friendly, welcoming and remembered our names the next time we came in a few days later. Literally EVERYTHING we ordered was outstanding from the Oysters Rockefeller to the Scallops, Crab Cakes and Homemade Key Lime Pie. We are hooked and will return every time we go back to Charlottesville.",32,63,view review

114,,Jane V.,30/10/24,,,,4,"We were really looking forward to dining at the Public Fish and Oyster.. sadly we all were a little underwhelmed. Service was excellent, the atmosphere is great, 
but wasn't what we expected. The oysters were delicious but the main courses were mediocre. I had the salmon which was a bit dry. Didn't flake and was drowned in a sauce. My friend ordered the lobster roll which was pretty pathetic. The bun engulfed the little bit of lobster, maybe 1/4 pound. Definitely not worth the money. The linguini was alright, the trout was good...  they do make a great Manhattan. 
I doubt we'll be returning for a full dinner, maybe just drinks and appetizers..",5,,view review
115,,Ann P.,31/10/24,,,,3,"My husband and I went for our anniversary this year. We have two children, one being a newborn so going out for a date night is a rare and special occasion. We got to our reservation on time and had the worst seat in the restaurant, we were sandwiched between two tables and extremely close to the bar. I completely understand tables have to be close together especially in a busy restaurant on a Saturday night but it was hard for the waitress to get to us and I felt like it was almost used as an excuse to be neglected. When we ordered we ordered everything together because again, it was hard for our waitress to get to our table. We ordered a dozen oysters, a $90 bottle of wine and I got the moules frites and my husband got the shrimp linguini and I also got the ABC bread to dip in the broth of the mussels. I should have mentioned we wanted the oysters as an app but assumed it was an appetizer and the entrees would come after, but the waitress also never asked. We got everything all together, which was such a pain. Since the table was small I had to put the mussels bucket on the floor and we barely had any room for anything. I know I should have mentioned to get the appetizer first, but I also think the waitress should have asked. At a nice restaurant, they need to ask. I also never got the bread. 
The worst part was after we got the food, the waitress literally never came back. Never came back to ask how the food turned out, no water refills, no asking if we wanted something else to drink, literally nothing. So I couldn't even tell her the bread was missing. She was also very attentive to the table next to us, so I cant even blame it on her seeming to be busy. When she finally came back, when the restaurant was basically closing, we mentioned the bread. She brought it out and with extra and took it off our tab. She acted like she was doing a huge favor taking it off the tab, like thanks? The broth was cold by then and it was $4, I wasnt worried about paying for it, I actually wanted it with my meal.
All that being said, the food was very good, and the restaurant was beautiful. I would love to try it again and hope that it was just an off night. But I was very much looking forward to a nice night out with my husband for our anniversary, especially when you get a babysitter and spend a good bit of money on the meal, you'd hope to get better service.",4,,view review

117,,Teresa L.,02/12/24,,,1,4,"Love this addition to downtown Charlottesville! It makes me feel like I'm at an oyster bar in Charleston! The food and service was wonderful, however this place is really cramped. The tables are a tad too small for their dishes/plates and there's 1-2 too many tables crammed into the space because it was really hard to maneuver around, even servers were having to take turns walking up and down between the tables. Really enjoyed the food, but wish we had more space to be comfortable!",332,446,view review
118,,Justin V.,30/12/24,,,,3,I wasn't a fan of the shrimp linguini which was very bitter. The employees often sprayed cleaning chemicals adjacent to where I was eating so my food tasted like chemicals because of the smell. I enjoyed the bread and butter. Oysters were ok.,34,170,view review
119,,Michele D.,03/01/25,,,,5,"This is hands down the best spot for a special celebration, especially if you love quality, fresh seafood. From the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable--attentive, friendly, and genuinely welcoming. The staff made us feel like valued guests rather than just customers.

Now for the food! WOW. Plated beautifully, bursting with fresh flavor and no over the top seasonings. We selected the calamari, ceviche, oysters Rockefeller and fried oysters as starters for our table. The calamari with pickled vegetables seemed odd, but man what a killer combo, it was amazing! The ceviche was also a highlight on the tastebuds. And the serving sizes were large enough for our table of 4 to share easily. The main entrees we ordered were Rockfish and lobster roll. Super good and cooked to perfection! Dessert: keylime pie (get it, you won't be disappointed) Olive Oil cake and the chocolate pot. All exceptional and served with housemaid whipped cream. 

The ambiance is cozy yet casual and fun. You can tell this place is run with love and pride, and it shows in every detail. We'll definitely be back and recommending this gem to everyone we know. If you love fresh seafood and top-tier service, do yourself a favor and  check this spot out.",143,107,view review
