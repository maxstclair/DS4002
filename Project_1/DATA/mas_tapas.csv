Lauren M.,2/2/10 0:29,1,0,0,4,3,"This used to be my ""spot"" while at UVA undergrad (til 2005). They're open late - the place is always jumping (*note: they don't accept reservations and at peak hours expect to wait up to an hour), and the food was amazing. It seems as though the quality has declined over the last few years. 

*The patatas bravas are still good, the tortilla española has been too oily, cheese plates have been significantly downsized (but still tasty), and the seafood from time to time is over-sauced. 

If you aren't a tapas fanatic, you may still enjoy the restaurant because, even with the few 'not so perfect', most of the dishes are prepared and served wonderfully. 

The prices are pretty steep, but it's Charlottesville - what else could you expect? If you want cheap tapas,  go to DC. If you want great tapas, go to Spain. In the mean time, shoot on over to Main St. and try Si Tapas...then make your comparison ;)",165,27,IvQfIAGig4n8SxtztkCyaw,"Henrico, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=IvQfIAGig4n8SxtztkCyaw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/N5-1Hy32jFDMpTaNpHl6ag/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=
christopher r.,1/21/11 15:13,2,0,0,2,3,"Good for a drink and a conversation. No mas.

Wait time was over an hour on a Tuesday night, while being only third on the wait list (for 2). The food was edible, but no dish was outstanding.

Many diners staked out their tables for what seemed all night in a pleasant social atmosphere. 

The no-reservations system evidently has its loop holes, as people continually passed us throughout the night for a large party.

Their spanish wine list looked worth exploring more. Sangria was good.

Bacon-wrapped dates - unimpressed.
scallops - just ok.
empanada and salad - fine.",126,29,3t6fHJFiXO5hTqAIfNRIsg,"Denver, CO",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3t6fHJFiXO5hTqAIfNRIsg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/MNnGCUrjercMBIR4-tUZXA/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=
LanChi N.,10/12/12 5:53,0,1,1,1,4,"Came here for my friends belated birthday Dinner. It's a actually a very chill and calm atmosphere nothing to loud or crazy. The seating is a bit limited but they also have patio seating But it was cold so we chose to sit inside. We ordered  a few tapas and 1 large pitcher of Sangria (they only have red) which has about 6-8 cups. It is a bit stronger then sangria that i've had but it's really good. The tapas  we tried were:

Datil con tocino -fat, juicy, pitted Medjool dates roasted inside of applewood-smoked bacon-really good mix of sweet and salty

Jamon y queso -18 mos. aged Jamon Serrano and Manchego Cheese- good but it needed a crunchy element

Empanada-roasted local , organic pumpkin from Radical Roots,chevre,sage in a flaky pastry w/ crema, honey- the chevre overpowered the pumpkin a bit

Judion-local,pastured  Mangalisa pork belly w/ buttery white beans from Leon,local organic chard,mirepox,tomatoes and herbes  -pork belly was melt in your mouth and the white beans were firm but had a soft center. I think I  could have eaten a whole bowl of them.

Pato confitado-raditional Catalan dish of buttery duck confit w/ fresh figs, concord grapes., garlic,Amontillo, sweet butter

-figs were so fresh tasting 

wAtun-#1 Grade Yellowfin tuna grilled very rare only served w/smoked tomato alioli,grey sea salt- smoked tomato alioli was amazingly good.Tuna was a bit too over done but I'm used to eating raw tuna.

Chorizo -eponymous pork,garlic and pimenton sausage lightly grilled w/hearth-baked bread-chorizo had a nice snap to it.

Tortilla Espanola
the classic  Spainish tapa of yukon gold potatoes,sweet onions,local farm eggs,extra virgin olive oil, gray sea salt.- Dish was good but the potatos and onions lacked a bit of flavor the gray sea salt on top helped but w/o the salt the dish was a bit plain.


Our fave tapas were the Dates wrapped in bacon, the wAtun  yellowfin tuna w/ the smoked tomato alioli and the Judion mangalisa pork belly with buttery white beans.

All the dishes were really good and you could taste the freshness in the local ingredients.  Although the tapas are a bit pricey you have to remember that  your paying for quality of the food and experience .I am  for sure coming back the next time I'm in Charlottesville to see what other dishes they offer.",482,288,3AVQuOO4hQwDsJYMCcTwHA,"Fairfax, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3AVQuOO4hQwDsJYMCcTwHA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/pZNN8Z0-ctFfSfNiBXSesw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=
Joy G.,11/17/12 7:46,2,5,5,4,4,"First things first: I don't like tapas. Call me crazy but small portions (or the shudder-inducing ""nibbles"" or ""small plates""), jacked-up prices, and a whole dinner built around communal sharing with an overriding aftertaste of hunger are not my idea of a good time. I'm quite surprised that the whole restaurant scene built around tapas has lasted as long as it has, because my philosophy is, I've found this awesome dish. I've ordered it. And now that I know how good it is, the sight of your fork coming closer and closer to the food in front of me is enough to bring a rush of red to my head. 

Anyway, I'm giving Mas a pass on my general resentment of Tapas, because I had heard for quite some time about how good the food was and I can fully back that up. Mas also features tons of locally sourced ingredients, from AMFog mushrooms to beef from Free Union Grass Farm and Silky Cow, which is nice in that you can taste how fresh everything is but bad in that if you don't get here early enough, the kitchen runs out of the more popular dishes, like the bacon-wrapped dates. The menu also has quite the complicated symbol and key system, with things like FUN, WILD-CAUGHT, and BALANCED PAIRING. 

My table first ordered a small pitcher of sangria to share, and it was the perfect acidic balance of fruit and wine. I will say that I could have easily gone without my one glass of sangria if it meant that the $20 could have gone towards two extra dishes, but the birthday girl requested some booze. But you want to hear about the food! These were the dishes that came recommended by both Yelpers, friends, and waitress. 

Datil con Tocino: aforementioned bacon-wrapped dates. Comes 4 in one bowl. It's kind of impossible how something so simple can taste so delicious, but this was one of the dishes that I wish we could order extra of. 

Ensalada de espinaca: baby spinach with pine nuts, raisins, and mango vinaigrette. Palette-cleanser and provided some greens. 

Papas con crema: like a potato lasagna stuffed with Manchego cheese. Wait a bit for the cheese to crystallize on the bottom and you get nice crispy dark brown bits. 

Roasted artichoke hearts and goat cheese: wished for more hearth-baked bread. 

Chorizo: pork + garlic + pimenton sausage. I'd be okay with eating this, cheese, bread, and wine for the rest of my life. My stomach probably wouldn't. 

Empanada: pastry turnover stuffed with pumpkin, ginger, sage, with some cheese-like creme on the side. More savory than sweet. 

Fat Gulf shrimp grilled in their shells: my eyes popped out of my head as soon as I spotted a waiter carrying these babies to a nearby table. So succulent. It was like everything else in the world had disappeared and all that remained was the shrimp and I. 

Albondigas: beef and pork meatballs. Wanted more shrimp. 

We also ordered the hugely disappointing goat cheese cheesecake: the goat cheese managed to overpower any hints of sweetness or sugar. The little dollops of raspberry syrup on the side did not help. 

Tip: come as early as possible. My group of 7 came here at around 5:30 on a Friday and snagged the last big table in the back. Fifteen minutes in, a line had already started forming for tables, though there were still a few empty seats in front of the bar.

Would like to come back soon to have a Racion of that shrimp all for myself.",1423,1603,BAXqpS21alyoX4-Z5611Hg,"Newton, MA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BAXqpS21alyoX4-Z5611Hg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/y3yNwWVeWfGTpdfCNwVTmA/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=
Han V.,11/29/12 19:35,0,0,0,2,3,"The menu changes often so I suggest talking with your waiter and ask for descriptions and suggestions. I love the open kitchen and watching the chef prepare all the dishes. The food comes out quickly so props to the chefs but the service can be extremely slow because it can really crowded. From my experiences, your waiter can really great or really bad. They really need to make their service more consistent. 

Many of the items are just wonderful on the menu and I really like how they stay conscious on using seasonal and local items. My favorites include the yukon gold potatoes with aloi, bacon wrapped dates, artichoke goat cheese dip, shrimp with aoli and sea salt, beef tartar, and raw tuna salad. The plates can range from $4-$20 for the ""tapas"" or regular size and they offer the double sized portion for each dish. I suggest staying towards the lower end because I feel like the more expensive items are not worth it and are not as easy to share. 

Some items may also be a miss so be careful--again, I recommend talking to your waiter and telling them your preferences! For example, I tried their chirizo once and they were like a charred bricks. The Serrano ham dish with the manchego cheese is also not worth it because it's just really thin slices of cured meat with even thinner slices of cheese. Their hummus was also not very special. 

Tip: They do not take reservations so it's best to go during off times or weekdays. The wait can be 1-2 hours .

Tip: Instead of ordering the bread alone which is already $4, order the cheese dips because they include their house bread for just a few bucks more.

Naomi K.,3/15/13 18:30,0,0,0,0,4,"LOVE this place. Who knew that Charlottesville have a food cult?! What a great find. This was a perfect spot for dinner. It was a tricky finding the entrance on the patio but it was urban chic inside. The downstairs was super breezy near the door, so bring a coat! The setting was dark and modern. The bathrooms discretely overlooked the seating area, covered in wooden paneling. 
Food wise was a gastronome's delight! Of course the obligatory spanish olives, plethora of distinct cheeses and a larger selection of either wine or beer. Though I didn't find the papas bravas (roasted potatoes  w/alioli) that impressive, the jamon, empanadas and ensaladas were que delicioso! 
Save room for dessert, which was just as enticing. A smooth scoop of chocolate mousse artfully presented with sweet market fresh strawberries and a dollop of cream fraiche and coarse sea salt was perfection.",2071,486,wZG2xlICfUkJiY1NdPJH2A,"Raleigh, NC",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=wZG2xlICfUkJiY1NdPJH2A,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/y0jBkXl8pdKss6KFkaCraw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=
Esther G.,9/12/13 3:28,0,0,0,0,5,"This tapas place is definitely worth every star. Friendly waitress, intimate/classy yet fun setting (including a huge patio), fantastic food, killer sangrias, awesome company ... what else could you really want in a night? (Although I can't guarantee you the great company when you visit. Thankfully I came with great friends).

The restaurant uses ingredients from about a dozen or more local companies, which is an added bonus. Lots of organic and fresh vegetables and free-range chicken. Just looking at the menu and the vast array of choices can be overwhelming, but I feel like a lot of thought has put into not only the types of ingredients used but the way they're cooked/paired together to prepare each dish.

We ordered plenty of food for the three of us to share and feast on, but the one I keep remembering is the bacon-wrapped dates. I didn't even know I liked dates! Fat, juicy and pitted, roasted inside of applewood-smoked bacon. 

Another great dish: the smoked tomatoes that were resting in their own tomatoey juices.

Also had dessert: the dark, bittersweet flourless chocolate cake with berry coulis. It tastes exactly as it sounds!",499,241,1q9jZcsY4jG5ZjjgGIvvqA,"New York, NY",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1q9jZcsY4jG5ZjjgGIvvqA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ppTujCi7UP5yutiO2Xc9aQ/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=
Don C.,10/14/13 23:18,0,0,0,2,1,"We were excited to come to Mas for a great family dinner based on recommendations from friends and Yelp. Overall the tapas were pretty good with one big exception.  We ordered two orders of Carne Asada for our table and were a little surprised at how rare it was served. Believe me, I like my steak rare for the most part, but this was really, really rare.  Actually, it looked dangerously rare in my opinion. 

When our waitress came by we asked if we could please get the meat cooked a little more as we were concerned about how raw it looked. Much to our surprise we were told the chef will not cook it anymore because it is suppose to be served very rare.  Hunh?  Is the chef eating with us?!?  Is the chef paying for it?!?  I've never heard this before. 

Anyway, the servers were pleasant but the chef sounds like a real ass. His food certainly isn't nearly as good as he thinks it is!

Neelam P.,3/23/14 22:29,0,0,0,4,2,"My husband and I were debating between going to Mas or Parallel 38...wish we picked the latter.

Service was a bit horrible and our waitress disappeared throughout the night.  

The olives at the beginning were delicious. 

There are vegetarian options on the menu, but nothing really stood out.  

Moutabel - the description sounded better than it tasted!!  The beets just tasted like beet mush served with bread.  We couldn't taste the tahini or red peppers.  After a few bites the beets just become overwhelming.  

Queso cocido con alcachofa - goat cheese and artichokes.  This was ok, but the goat cheese was very heavy.  

Roasted veggies with bread - the bread was the best part (buttery and crunchy). The veggies were ok, nothing special and a bit bland.

Halibut - I liked this dish a lot and thought the fish was cooked very well.  

They ran out of the Babaghanouz the night we went.   I guess the menu changes often because the menu I saw online wasn't the same one we received.  The online menu looked much better and had so many vegetarian options!",1104,155,4ENBFSuIT-8vfRHZysQHag,"Chatham, NJ",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4ENBFSuIT-8vfRHZysQHag,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/geH46148ietz8yfydiHXOQ/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=
Lumiere S.,5/20/14 4:11,2,4,4,6,5,"I try to be a mindful reviewer when I yelp, and do check out a review or two of popular places before posting my own. That being said, I do acknowledge that one poster said for those who are foodies and have eaten elsewhere, this place is not that great. I would have to respectfully disagree - I have eaten in quite a few different U.S. cities (LA, Chicago, NYC, DC, Philly, etc.), as well as abroad, and still really enjoy Mas! 

I will say that the wait is pretty bad, but if you manage to entertain yourself for the +1 hour wait - I would say it's worth it. Why? Well, each dish is it's own little theatrical show. I felt the flavors were purposely chosen and paired and the items were prepared carefully and well. My personal favorite would be the lamb shank,  bacon wrapped dates (I know, I know, everyone said it already but it's for a reason!), as well as the papas bravas (not the sexiest dish, but I love the herbs used on the potatoes and the serving size is gracious).

Bottom line - this place has a nice exposed brick and wood charm that is akin to a lot of local owned places in NY and the atmosphere, although dim, feels upbeat and social. The last time I was here was with a group of 5. It was the ideal size for sharing dishes and still getting enough that we each felt full. I thought our service was decent, but can completely understand the complaints. :/

In closing - I say try it out if you're curious - it can't hurt, and you'll find that you enjoyed a piece of Charlottesville in the process. May the fork be with you.",205,853,oJlnV8VcmvBhhU92K4a3aA,"Charlottesville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oJlnV8VcmvBhhU92K4a3aA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/hqklS0bl28Whleo-bv6pVQ/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=
Katie S.,8/11/14 15:11,0,0,0,3,5,"We were looking for a place for dinner after wine tasting in the area on Saturday and the owner of the B&B we stayed at recommended Mas Tapas, so off we went. 

I have to be honest here, you can never tell with tapas, so I was slightly unsure of how much to order, but picking 2-3 things each for our table of 4 left us all content and didn't break the bank. 

We started (and ended) our meal with the bacon wrapped dates (yep, they were so good we ordered them twice), a pitcher of sangria and a potato dish, while we waited at the bar for a table to open up.  

It took about an hour for our name to be called; the hostest wasn't comfortable quoting us a time when she put us on this list, since she said with tapas if people don't show up at the same time (I guess they were spread out this particular evening) it's hard to gauge how long they will stay.   I really appreciated her being so up-front about this. 

It was actually pretty cool watching the restaurant work so well together as a team! They were slammed, but you would never know it by the level of service we received.

Once we were seated we transferred our tab to our table (I double checked this didn't short the bartender and was assured it wouldn't) and ordered several more small plates to share. I LOVED the shrimp, the hummus, Plato de Jamon and the heirloom tomatoes.  

We split the goat cheese cheesecake (I was intrigued) and even though I wasn't a huge fan of it, my dinner companions had no problem making it disappear very quickly. 

Overall great experience and great food.

Lucas B.,9/18/15 15:37,3,1,1,6,4,"I've been waiting to go to Mas Tapas ever since I heard my girlfriend and some friends that went to school in Charlottesville raving about it. I have even seen someone drop a few lines about Mas in a review for MY favorite tapas place, Estadio in DC.

I finally got my chance to experience Mas when I went to UVa for a football weekend. We went on a Friday night around 9pm so we could eat some tapas and drink some sangria before hitting downtown.

We ended up waiting around 35 minutes so they could accommodate our table of 10 on what appeared to be a busy night. The wait wasn't too bad! The giant jug of Sangria (highly recommended - it's very good) kept us busy until we were ready to be seated.

We were seated outside with a few tables pushed together and everyone was comfortable. The server came around and gave us our menu's and took some drink orders. The menu is VERY extensive so you'll need to take a few minutes looking up and down it. Be careful though because there are so many things that sound amazing.

All of the food we ordered came out in a very reasonable amount of time too!

4/5 - Bacon wrapped dates - I'm not usually a fan of any type of date or bacon wrapped thing. Dates taste weird and usually when things are wrapped in bacon the bacon is still mushy or rubbery. These were a completely different story. The bacon was actually crispy around the date and the entire bite was delicious. Would definitely order these again.

5/5 - Manchego and apples - Obviously not the fanciest thing you can order but the quality of the cheese and apples was fantastic. Both had a ton of flavor and complimented each other very well.

3.5/5 - Jumbo shrimp with garlic aioli - I'm not the biggest fan of in-shell shrimp as I'm more of a butter and garlic drowned shrimp fan but this was still pretty good. Everyone around the table absolutely loved it.

4.5/5 - Carne asada - I will eat steak pretty much any way I can get it. They cook the carne asada rare only but I'm fine with it. It's topped with a smoked tomato aioli that pairs nicely with the rare beef.

5/5 - Octopus and Pork Noodle dish - I'm not sure what this dish was called but it was my favorite of the night by FAR. The pork was tender and the octopus was charred exactly how I like it. Not to mention it was spicy as hell so it was right up my alley. Loved it.

All in all I really enjoyed my meal here and it lived up to expectations. This isn't the fanciest style of tapas you will see out there but the food has just as much flavor as any other place. If you enjoy small plates and are in the area (except on Sundays - closed), this is a good bet for you.",473,545,NvTI0n5PhXdJYxTtRPRzrw,"Charlotte, NC",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NvTI0n5PhXdJYxTtRPRzrw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/DklgNAff6_vgGEPeKxDGhw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=

It's totally worth the the walk from the downtown mall, it's easy to find and just about 10 minutes on foot - make the trip!

After an initially slow service, we got our table after about 20 minutes wait, and yes - it was still totally worth it!

Go for the wine selection, which is fairly large and interesting with European wines (I tried the red sangria excitedly, but didn't particularly like it).

We then ordered 7 different tapas which made us more than full. The melted cheese on brioche with honey was one of my favorites, but absolutely everything was great, including the homemade bread and yummy olives.

Christina Z.,10/26/16 3:42,0,0,0,0,4,"Tasty plates but definitely a little overpriced. If you're looking for an authentic tapas place, this does not quite hit the mark - I would say that it adopts the tapas style with its small plate offerings, but does not quite live up to other tapas restaurants and does not offer the variety of authentic Spanish dishes that you would expect. The dishes are flavorful, however, and come in a small/""tapas"" option or a larger/""raciones"" option (usually double the price of the tapas). My husband and I ordered 6 dishes in the tapas size, and we felt that the portions were appropriate to share between 2 people. We left satisfied but not overly stuffed.

Carol F.,10/31/16 22:48,0,0,0,1,4,"I had heard great things about this restaurant and I would say it definitely lived up to the hype!

We came here in a group of 2 prime time on a Friday night. There was quite a wait, as expected, so we split a bottle of wine as we waited. There wasn't much of a waiting area... I felt bad hovering over other tables as we waited, but there wasn't much of an option as it was too cold to wait outside.

Bar area was first come-first serve, but you kind of have to fight for it. Several people who came after us grabbed seats as soon as people at the bar stood up, so you may want to make clear to others behind you that you're waiting for the bar.

After about 45 minutes wait, we got a table downstairs. While we were waiting, we marked all the tapas we wanted on their paper menu. So, we didn't have to wait too long for our food to come out after we sat. 

All the tapas were soo delicious, so many must-tries!

""Papas Bravas"" - The potatoes with garlic aioli - SO fragrant and yummy, you just keep going back for more. This left us taking small bites just so we could savor it more. It's one of those that's such a simple and basic dish, but somehow I don't think I could replicate it at home.

""Carne asada"" - steak with tomato aioli. Offered in rare only - amazing and delicious! Make sure to dip each bite into the sauce. I'm making myself hungry as I type this...

Some kind of jumbo shrimp - pretty good although probably the least celebrated at our table that night. Not that it wasn't good, just overpowered by everything else that was more amazing. 

Artichoke and goat cheese dip - I really liked this. Although if you're not a big fan of goat cheese, I probably wouldn't recommend. The bread it was served with was extremely hard.. It made it hard to break off to eat with the dip.

Grilled octopus served over bread - cooked perfectly, softened octopus and paired really well with the breading. 

""Datil con tocino"" - bacon wrapped dates. Although it seems an appetizer, it was the last one to arrive at our table, so it acted as our dessert. And it just turned out to be perfect that way, as it's a little savory, a little sweet. Charred smokey taste and just so good. 

So that journey of 6 dishes is enough for you to try an explosion of different flavors, and it came out to about $60 total. Very reasonable price for how great it was!

Fun fact: their special of the night was barnacle. weird right?! We passed this time, but I look forward to to coming back maybe when I'm feeling adventurous and trying one of their other weird specials :P

SO: 4.5 stars for such awesome flavors but minus half a star for lack of waiting area and having to hover over other people's tables for almost an hour, and perhaps a suggestion for softer bread to accompany the dips!",255,606,PdPrqYLWDjNPnpXOQ1zgIw,"Round Rock, TX",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=PdPrqYLWDjNPnpXOQ1zgIw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/g4e1mYC0xgbZi4f8sHmbSA/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=

Our server was very kind and knowledgeable! She has excellent recommendations that adhered to our dietary restrictions! Definitely one of the best places in terms of service. 

On to why I didn't give the place 5 stars. The wine and cocktail menus come in actual binders. I thought that was very cute. And the actual menu is one piece of paper. Everyone knows that the alcohol and food options are plentiful. But having to squint in a low lighting dining area to read the crammed menu was not ideal. I would suggest having another binder just for food on it's on and creating quarter sheets of paper where people can write what they want to order.

It was all quite delicious and I would definitely go back if we want tapas when we're in Charlottesville next time. I was not a fan of the cheese cake at all.

They then brought they last tapa, a set of bacon wrapped dates so charred they were nearly unrecognizable.  We were offered a paltry insincere apology with the caveat that ""this is what happens when it gets late around here"".

This place is always consistent and has been for the 15 years I've been dinning there. Mas has a great staff that are very attentive even if the place is jam packed.

Angel H.,12/16/17 3:16,0,0,0,0,5,"Definitely one of my favorites in Charlottesville! Food is very high quality, unique, flavorful, and overall heavenly. The menu is quite extensive- so many tapas to pick from! Drinks are great- especially the sangria. 

We started off the simple oven baked bread. It was nice and chewy in the inside and went so well with the olive oil and olives at the table. The ribeye was salted perfectly and served with freshly made basil! Every bite was rich and juicy. Probably my favorite meat dish. The empanada was crispy and the meat inside was spiced perfectly! There's only one empanada for the tapas portion but it's big enough to split it. 

My favorite tapa was the mussels. They were so fresh and juicy, and would have tasted amazing even without the sauce. The sauce, however, is to die for. It's this rich tomato puree that can be served as a nice tomato bisque, except it has all the juices from the mussels. There's a little piece of bread that comes with the dish, perfect for dipping into the sauce. I was surprised by how big this tapa was but even more surprised at how delicious the mussels were (seriously, best mussels I've ever had in my life). 

Patatas bravas are authentic (even better than the ones I've had in Seville actually). The garlic aioli sauce was such a nice combo with the hot, greasy potatoes. Be careful not to burn your tongue! They also make great leftovers and taste just as good microwaved. The carne asada was pretty good, too. Very high quality meat, they put too much sauce and it kind of drowned the entire dish. Finally, we had the truffle grilled cheese sandwich (I forgot the actual name on the menu). The bread was a tad too charred for my liking, but the rich flavor of the truffles and the warm, melted cheese made up for it. A very filling tapa! 

Mas Tapas is a great place to dine! Food is fantastic and will not disappoint. Ambiance is cozy and romantic and service is great. The tapas turned out to be larger than I thought. My boyfriend and I were absolutely stuffed after 7 tapas and had to take the patatas bravas home. There's limited parking in the little lot behind the restaurant. It's popular though, so get there a few minutes before it opens or anticipate a wait!",510,454,STRj5yYm51v2dooHmIYLpQ,"Newark, NJ",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=STRj5yYm51v2dooHmIYLpQ,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/5yE2H_9aZhhlxWAxoyDCoQ/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=
Audrey P.,1/8/18 2:18,0,0,0,3,4,"Without a doubt this is one of the best restaurants in Charlottesville! On the pricier end, for sure, but definitely worth it. 

The food: The sangria is excellent! Be sure to get a large pitcher ($30 and will be enough for about 8 glasses). Our favorite dishes were the Papas Bravas (potatoes with aioli), Queso cocido con alcachofa (artichoke and goat cheese spread), Trinxat (potatoes, cabbage, pork belly, duck fat), and Carne asada (WOW, this was great). The menu is extensive and is broken down into different price points. Our server was great about explaining the menu items and portion sizes to us so we could set expectations and determine how much to order. 

The logistics: They don't take reservations so I would suggest an early dinner or other odd times if you don't like to wait. I came with a group right when they opened at 5:30 and the restaurant was already filling up fairly quickly. This setting also isn't great for groups - they don't seat until the entire party is present and they don't split checks. The plates are fairly difficult to share with groups larger than 4 unless you're okay getting only a bite (or sometimes even half a bite) of certain dishes. However, for a date, this restaurant is perfect!

Michael L.,4/4/18 21:51,0,0,0,3,5,"THE BIG: Located on the corner of Monticello and Carlton. Medium sized restaurant with no prior reservations aka first come first serve. There are outdoor seating, but only when it's nice outside. Street parking is available.

THE BLACK AND WHITE: We came here on a nice March night. Outside was still cold so none of the patio section was open but I can definitely picture a cool summer night with tapas and sangria.

I'm pretty sure there's always a wait because when we got here (~5:45pm), there were already 7 tables in front of us...and people still kept showing up. It took us about 45 minutes to get seated, thankfully we got a pitcher of sangria to hold us over. $30 for a large pitcher that serves 8 glasses, not bad.

---As for the food---
-Cauliflower: Curry flavored and essentially dissolved in your mouth
-Papas Bravas: The garlic aioli was dope and the potatoes were nicely cubed out
-Scallop: Just one scallop but it was done right. Had big roe pieces on top and a potato-ey spread below it. 
-Bacon-wrapped Dates: Sweet meets savory. Only comes with 4
-Carne Asada: Evenly cooked-cut steak with a nice serving of a buttery yellow sauce on top

Sungmin S.,4/8/18 19:00,1,0,0,0,3,"We were first in line at 5:20pm, and by 5:45 there was a LONG line out the door. Tapas is one of my favorite types of food and seeing the hype, I was quite excited to try out Mas. Here are the items we shared:

- goat cheese artichoke dip: fine, not amazing; strong on chevre
- jamon: incredible quality but VERY small, sad pieces and very pricey (around $15) for what we got. 
- bacon wrapped dates: hard to mess this one up. good but I've had much bigger bacon wrapped dates elsewhere 
- lamb meatballs: good flavor but fell apart easily
- shrimp: very plump and grilled well, served with incredibly thick aioli
- carne asada: cooked well but I was disappointed by how the dish came out cold. who wants their meat served not hot? 

I did not order a drink, but my friends' sangria and cocktail were reportedly watered down and not very good. 

Overall, food was only okay and very pricey.

Kelly C.,6/3/18 21:08,0,0,0,1,2,"Came to Charlottesville from Northern Virginia and was stocked to try this place all weekend! So disappointed and kind of odd with all the other great reviews. 

Service: 2 of 5 - The moment we walked in the door we were rudely greeted and our information was taken down for the waitlist. Had 3 parties ahead of us and asked for a rough ballpark of estimated wait time and was abruptly told ""they don't give estimates"" as the girl rushed off. Okay, I get it - can't give wait times but she came across really inappropriately and almost made me want to walk out the door. Our actual server wasn't too bad. 

Food: 3 of 5 - I get it, this place puts a hipster vibe on Spanish Tapas but the authenticity was a poor excuse for the rendering of the concept. My boyfriend (who is Salvadoran) even noticed that the beer on their menu and country of origin listed were incorrect (pretty much a slap in the face) to Spanish culture. 

Value: 2 of 5 - Tried this spot on a mini-vacation and spent over $200 with drinks included for the two of us. The only dish that was remotely decent was the artichoke and goat cheese dip. Too bad this was the first dish we put in order in for and the very last thing we were served.

I don't know, I'll give them benefit of the doubt and maybe we caught them on a bad night but overLl a very poor experience.

Tyshera E.,6/24/18 18:32,0,1,1,4,1,"My friends and I were very excited about our trip to this restaurant. The entire time on our walk there, we discussed how happy we were to try this place. One of my friends, it was her birthday, had chosen this restaurant because she had always heard good things. I did not know much about it, but being from the Charlottesville area, I was familiar with the location. So, I knew the area wasn't going to be all that racially diverse thanks to all of the gentrification around the Belmont area. 

When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a host who urged us to choose a seat inside, so there would be less of a wait. We complied and were squeezed at a table in the rear of the restaurant. A waitress soon approached us and offered up a few friendly suggestions on what we should order. We let her know that two of my friends were vegetarians and that I was allergic to selfish, so we would have to steer clear of those options. She then proceeded to lecture me on carrying my epipen everywhere I go. This has never happened to me at a restaurant. i have also never been spoken to in such a condescending way by someone before. I have gone to many restaurants and told wait staff about my allergy and they are usually very understanding. This waitress was not. She made it seem like I had inconvenienced the entire restaurant. She very unenthusiastically said ""I'll have to run everything by the kitchen now.""

The rest of the meal was uncomfortable. I cannot remember if I even liked the taste of the food. All I can remember is a white woman yelling at me because of my food allergies. My advice to anyone who is interested in tapas in the Charlottesville area. Try Bang! It's within walking distance of this tone-deaf place and is actually quite delicious. There aren't weird photos of white people doing yoga on the walls and I was treated with respect and courtesy while I was. Moral of the story: Skip this place. It's expensive. They're rude. And you can definitely get a better meal somewhere else.

The seasoning profile is pretty similar across all the items we ordered - olive oil, paprika, harrisa, etc. They are going for authentic Spanish tapas, which we appreciated. The patatas bravas were not like I am used to - small crispy potatoes - but rather big soft hunks in sauce. Bill was less than $100, but we did not order alcohol or meat.

Yes, they do not take reservations, so get there early and make sure your entire party is present. My boyfriend and I arrived around 6:30 PM and we eventually found a seat at the bar to grab a few drinks. Sangria was wonderful and perfect addition to our meal.

It seems as if their menu is overwhelming with options, but the staff are always willing to explain and give their suggestions. Based on that, I ordered the carne asada for sure! The meat was so tender and flavorful, I almost wanted to order another, but had to save room for the other dishes. (All of their dishes come in two sizes!) The papas bravas and the brussel sprouts were warm and extremely flavorful with their sauces. The shrimp was also very good.

The food we had was all tasty. Our favorites were the duck Empanadas, roasted tomatoes and Carne Asada.

I loved the vibe at Mas. It was perfect for a date night, but would have also been fun for a group.

David T.,12/4/18 16:24,2,2,2,2,3,"My wife and I had heard rave reviews about Mas Tapas from friends and colleagues so we were really looking forward to finally experiencing it. While its definitely worth trying, it didn't quite meet our expectations with many of the plates being a little underwhelming for the cost.  I wish I could tell you what plates we got but the menu is near indecipherable with names you'll never be able to remember (even immediately after ordering).  So you will place your order on the sheet provided for the table and then be surprised as the plates you order come out randomly.

Décor wise mas tapas is kind of all over the place.  When you walk it works hard to evoke that certain posh atmosphere with semi-uniformed / dressed-up staff to greet and serve you.  There's a nice variety of seating options with a neat, second room down a flight of stairs. Tapas also has a beautiful long bar for those looking to grab a quick seat.  Myself and the two women I was with agreed that the art on the wall was a little confusing.  I'm having problems remembering what I saw but it was an odd mash up of  overly sexual close-up photos.  

Drink wise I was happy with the dirty martini I received and the girls liked the wine options available to them.  Foodwise, we ordered a bread and cheese plate which came with slices of green apple.  While everything was good quality the presentation was pretty plain and underwhelming.  We liked the baked wings and I enjoyed the thin slice of rare beef.  Everyone loved the potatoes au gratin although the ladies commented that it was presented differently than they were used to.  Flavor-wise it was exceptional.  The goat cheese cheese cake was also very unique.

I would try Mas Tapas again but with more tempered expectations.",526,111,N5EK5jSHIf91MnnYpQKQJQ,"Charlottesville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=N5EK5jSHIf91MnnYpQKQJQ,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/LSNoay4a1IffUyurhvz8nQ/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=

The drinks are deliciously prepared from skilled bartenders and the food is always fresh and yummy. I especially like that the menu is so seasonal; it's always changing.

The carne asada truly stole the show as a Racion ( Had the tapa in a prior visit and the Racion was definitely the better bet for the value) Sangria was delicious and stronger than expected which was a good way to start the night. 

Definitely recommend arriving 10 minutes early before opening to immediately get a table as waits can be up to 2 hours depending on the night (so the earlier the better)

The service upheld the traditional tapas style in making sure to consistently bring out the dishes we ordered one after another, so we were never lacking food nor overloaded with too many plates at once. We sat outside in their spacious outdoor area but were attentively tended to throughout our visit without being forgotten about.

And now, the best part: the food. Mas offered a huge menu of tapas ranging from traditional Spanish plates (like my all-time favorite tapa to order, patatas bravas) to unique spins, like the roasted curried cauliflower with coconut milk. By far the best was the queso la tur on toasted bread with melty cheese and thick honeycomb. It was so delicious we ended up ordering it again. The extra large pitcher of sangria might have contributed to that...

Gina C.,8/13/19 2:39,0,0,0,0,3,"I had high hopes for Mas because it appeared on several Charlottesville restaurant lists, had great Yelp reviews, and was recommended by my husband who had an memorable meal here a couple of years ago. Unfortunately (and my husband would agree) that the food came up short this time. 

It was our first meal in Charlottesville after over 3 hours of driving in rush hour traffic from DC, so we were hungry and ready to be easily impressed. Our server, who reminded me of the leader singer of Muse, recommended a bunch of dishes and we ordered all of them: the cauliflower, papas bravas, tortilla Espanola​, grilled artichoke hearts with garlic aioli​, wild gulf shrimp, heirloom carrots, and ""ginormous"" sea scallop with parsnip & celery root puree. The cauliflower came out first and it raised the bar sky high. Roasted in coconut milk, ginger, turmeric, sweet onions, and sea salt, it was the best rendition of cauliflower I've ever had. I found myself trying to commit its subtle but warm and rich flavor to memory so that I could try to recreate it. Sadly, as the rest of the tapas came out, the bar set by the cauliflower quickly came crashing down. The carrots were undercooked, the papas bravas were mushy, the artichokes tasted like they were from a can, and the ""ginormous"" sea scallop was not ginormous enough to warrant a $14 price tag. These tapas tasted like they were made by a completely different caliber restaurant than the one that made the cauliflower. The gulf shrimp briefly interrupted the lackluster lineup. Large, juicy, and perfectly seasoned, they could stand on their own without the smooth garlic aioli that it sat on top of. I was particularly surprised that out of over 40 different tapas on the menu, our server did not recommend better ones. Not sure if he was upselling us (such as with the scallop) or trying to get rid of less popular ingredients. 

Thankfully the night ended on a sweet note with a delightful flourless chocolate cake. And the entire night was saved by the stellar gin cocktails and the chill, hipster atmosphere that made us feel young, cool, and transported from DC. 

Our bill came out to be ~$65pp with tax and tip which was about 20% more than I expected. I would consider giving Mas another try to cobble together a better tasting, better value lineup of tapas. If I fail to recreate their cauliflower, I'll have to.",46,217,aUbBUueEGnMs-ENCBoLbCw,"Washington, DC",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=aUbBUueEGnMs-ENCBoLbCw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/iSZNtih7P7SwtuGld23wsg/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=

As we waited for nearly 25 minutes to have a server come to our table frustrations mounted. We went and looked for the host to ask for service. When our server finally arrived, we were not greeted with apologetic  pleasantry. Instead, we were hit with a ""first of all"". We were never explained the process for ordering and met with contempt when we had questions. After eating at many other tapas restaurants, Mas had a different process. While we should have just left calling the experience a wash, our hunger made us stay. 

After speaking to the manager our drinks and starter were comped, but still felt as though the reason for our concerns were not fully understood. 

Our server continued to provide mediocre service at best throughout the rest of our dinner.

We both started with a cup of regular coffee. Minor complaint is that it didn't appear to be a bottomless cup. However we did order drinks for our meal, so maybe the server just assumed we didn't want more. 

For the meal I had the shrimp with polenta and a blood orange mimosa. All was great. While I had plenty to eat, for the price I thought my portion was a bit small.

I ordered the flan just because and honesty it exceeded my expectations. Cappuccino was also legit.

We have even taken the kids for a special night out and they (the kids) suprised us with their adventurous tastes.  Mas has been great with take-out during shelter-in-place/semi-shutdown - family style meals are available at reasonable prices.  
As far as our personal recommendations - we've never gone wrong with arugula salad, carne asada, grilled tuna (always perfectly rare), gambas (shrimp), bouqerones(anchovies), papas bravas (perfectly roasted potatoes), and the pla' piqueno (amazing manchego thinly sliced, served with housebaked bread and apples - yum!) all of which have been available for take-out at this time.

The take out service is super easy where they bring the food right to your car. The food itself was delish. Didn't take a picture because plating is not my strong suit but we ordered: 

- carne asada: Cooked perfectly, our favorite tapa
- coliflor: SO GOOD. Got turned onto this after trying it at conmole across the street a big who and I have to say, both places do an amazing job
- bacon wrapped dates: only came with 4 (two screens of two) but so good 
- hongos: these were a little weird. Tasty, but kind of odd 
- papas bravas: usually one of my favorites, although I wasn't super impressed here in comparison to the other food. Still definitely good though! 
- sangria: YUM! One order was perfect for 2 glasses

Jessi S.,3/7/21 23:06,1,3,3,6,3,"High expectations, but mediocre tapas. Half the dishes were good, but basic, and the other half left us wishing we ordered something else. It's incredibly difficult to get reservations now because there are only 5 tables and the seating is 1hr 45min long. We felt rushed by our server so we picked 2 dishes right away to start: chorizo and carne asada. The carne asada ended up being one of the better dishes and our favorite- caution, the meat may still be mooing. The chorizo was good, but definitely have had better. The posole (chicken stew) was bland and unimpressive...waste of stomach space. Then, we ordered the chuletas (lamb chops) and pescado (rockfish), which offered some promising flavors. The fish happened to be the table favorite. The bocato (pork cheek) was my personal favorite. Having some room left after all these dishes, we cumulatively decided to order 2 more dishes: pintxo (rabbit pate) and oyster mushrooms. Both of these dishes were awful and a disappointing end to our dinner. We basically forced our bites to finish our plates. The pate was a runny gravy slopped onto bread. And the mushrooms ruined it all from there. I'd like to give this place another chance reading all the hype and order other dishes, but I'm worried that I'll be left disappointed once again.",437,386,LK2cFPrCgHc8shHfG1bN-w,"Baltimore, MD",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LK2cFPrCgHc8shHfG1bN-w,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/vqfG8_H8_RZsAKzlPE1Uew/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=
Reane S.,3/11/21 18:39,0,1,1,3,3,"We were so looking forward to this dinner due to several recommendations with some rave reviews and as such had high expectations. Sadly, our dinner overall was a let down.
We started off with chorizo which was disappointing and carne asada. Having had chorizo at different Spanish / Hispanic restaurants, this one was mediocre. It lacked the spice of a typical highly seasoned Spanish pork sausage. The tenderloin that came with a warning of being grilled VERY RARE , was on point, delicious and definitely one of the best carne asada , according to my husband. The aioli with it brought out the flavor even more. 
We then moved on to Posole - chicken stew which was supposed  to have a nice blend of onions & poblano peppers which would have given it a nice distinctive taste. We thought it was just meh..
We also ordered Bocato which was braised pork cheeks with a delicious meld of flavors in a brioche. We loved it!
Another winner was the pescado which was a tasty, slightly crispy seared rockfish - definitely a must have!
The chuletas (baby lamb chops) unfortunately failed to impress. We think they were overly trimmed of fat.
We wanted to try something else so we ordered the Pintxo and the Hongos. We shouldn't have. Both dishes were unimpressive. The rabbit liver - black truffle pate was a tasteless gray smear on bread. The grilled mushrooms were neither interesting nor good. A shame that it was the last taste in our mouths at the end of our meal.

Tuna Salad - nice mix of arugula with plenty of chunks of yellowfin tuna plus capers, onions, and shaved manchego cheese. Super tasty. 

Albondigas - juicy beef/pork/lamb meatballs in a very flavorful romesco sauce.
 
Carne Asada - seared perfectly and then basically rare. My wife and I like it that way, but I'm sensitive that others like their beef cooked more.

Arroz con Pollo - I'm not sure if the chicken was smoked or the pepper in the sofrito, but this dish had a very nice smoky note to it.

Hummus - good pepper and garlic flavors in this version.

Neil S.,2/1/22 20:25,1,0,0,2,4,"When we first lived in Charlottesville, my wife and I considered Mas Tapas the best ""fancy"" restaurant in town due to its flavorful and relatively unique Spanish offerings. We finally got a chance to check out this Belmont staple again since moving back, and this time we brought friends. Doing so allowed us to sample even more of the menu. Happily, we found the food here as good as ever.

Dining with a party of four allowed us to sample nine different tapas, and not one was a dud. Some of our favorites included tender baby lamb chops paired with a zesty chimichurri, a tender roast octopus, a crock of creamy goat cheese-artichoke dip (perfect with the house crusty bread), and Mas's take on the classic patatas bravas (with roasted rather than fried spuds). While still good, some of the slightly less successful dishes we tried included the mussels (difficult to manage at a small table, and not the freshest) and the tortilla (eggs a bit overcooked and underseasoned). Though we ordered 9 dishes, they came out in waves of three which made negotiating the limited real estate at our tiny table feasible. 

The drink program here focuses on, unsurprisingly, Spanish wine with a tight selection of draft beer and some cocktails. My wife enjoyed her wine, though my cocktail was strictly okay. While a meal here can get pricey, I find that the ingredients generally of high quality and the overall cost subsequently reasonable.

The sangria was not sufficiently sweet for me, so, if you prefer a more dry flavored sangria, then you would be more likely to enjoy this one. The colts de bruselas were cheesy with delicious crispy bacon and delicate hints of rosemary. The mejilones were as good as I have tasted with a delectable thin sauce. The ensalada de atun had fresh tuna and a light dressing perfectly applied to the salad. The gambacitos al ajillo were divine with a scrumptious sauce.

Jo L.,3/27/22 15:11,0,0,0,1,5,"Hands-down the best restaurant in Charlottesville. It was difficult to get a reservation considering how popular this place is, so I'd recommend booking early.

PARKING
It was difficult to find parking when we arrived, so getting there early is a must. There's a small lot behind the restaurant that was full when we got there. We ended up parking in a plaza lot across the street but wouldn't recommend it for risk of being towed.

FOOD
Oh gosh, the food here is absolutely stellar. Our table ordered the coliflor, papas bravas, tortilla espanola, boquerones, bocadillo, and arroz con pollo. They were all to die for, but the bocadillo took the cake for me. I'll have to try the desserts and the carne asada (heard nothing but good things about it) next time around.

The drinks were pretty standard (still wonderful), and were decorated nicely. No complaints here.

SERVICE
Our server was very kind. When our order didn't arrive for the hour we were there, he took it off our check. He also explained the vegetarian items available very well and sold us on the restaurant at large.

AMBIANCE
The ambiance was absolutely lovely. There's an open bar where you can see food being made, and the entryway to the two floors of the restaurant made it appear lofty and spacey. The art also fit the casual, fancy vibes as well.",400,12,k0v1tG5Tu9eXirZwomtoXw,"Fairfax, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=k0v1tG5Tu9eXirZwomtoXw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/NEo9cCJuQo12bSQ72_oPpQ/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=

The bacon wrapped dates were good; however, I've had them before elsewhere and can tell you that the addition of some blue cheese inside and a sprinkle of brown sugar would take these from good, to stellar.  The arroz con pollo, was a plate full of arroz and not much pollo, the piece of fat and another piece of gristle is what ultimately forced me to send this back.   Adding a star for the server who handled this well and took the item off our check.   We followed with the tortilla which were lackluster, warm, and a bit dry scalloped potatoes.    Even the Manchego cheese appetizer was off. I often buy Manchego at Costco and find the texture smoother and more flavorful.   One more tapas ordered were the lamb sliders, (1 slider actually), with goat cheese.   For those who like the stronger flavor of lamb if would be great to order, this was just too much for me.   $73 for 4 tapas (the chicken and mostly rice was deducted beforehand), a sangria and glass of wine.

My fiancé and I take an annual trip to Charlottesville. This was our first time visiting Mas Tapas with two of our close friends. We wined and dined till our hearts and bellies were full. We ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table. Let me tell you - the flavors were delectable, not to mention this drink was STRONG. We were all feeling good and relaxed after finishing one pitcher. 

The small plates. Where to begin? We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, chorizo, yellowfin tuna, carne asada, and, baked dessert cheese . . . just to name a few. Every plate was DELIGHTFUL. Packed full of flavor and prepared with an eye for detail. It's the type of food that is so good, your conversation only centers around the savoriness in your mouth. Every bite was divine.

Is Alex a female  cause she likes to bark at customers...

I recently dined at Mas Tapas. We were placed at an awkward table b/c the table reserved for us had issues. Since we were seated in an awkward space, I went up to the host stand to see if we could sit in another area since there was ample open seating. As I'm speaking... Alex, their Saturday manager, cuts me off mid-sentence. She barked, ""NO."" at me, looked me dead in the face, and continued with her matters. I was stunned. Never have I been spoken to that way by service staff especially when it was completely uncalled for and unprompted.

Your stress levels do not give you a pass to mistreat people. I've worked in the service industry before and I NEVER treated guests that way. If any team member did so, they would be fired. It was very clear that one of their younger servers (who was such a pleasure) felt so uncomfortable. He tried to make it right... which is why I believe we got a few free drinks.

Alex never apologized... she continued to prance around like she's all that. Sorry to say, if you can't treat people with respect ESPECIALLY in the service industry... You are not all that and you have no business being in hospitality.

Lisa G.,2/3/24 3:01,0,0,0,0,2,"Yeeks... hate to give a poor review from a place I have always thought was the best. But tonight at Mas, the food was sad. The garlic shrimp was a big bowl of popcorn shrimp floating in sauce- like probably 20 shrimp, where it should have been 4 or so nice jumbo shrimp.  Sauce was okay but the garlic sauce I make at home kills this one. And that baby shrimp all curled in balls is so off putting. The lamb lollipops - the meat portion was a small as a nickel. I know lamb lollipops well and I know they are small but these were super super small.  The tomato bread was inedible. It was more like Italian bruschetta than Spanish tomato bread which would have been fine but the tomatoes were smoked and it was like a whole bottle of liquid smoke had been poured on them. It left a film in your mouth that you couldn't get rid of. It was way way too smoky and also a disappointment that it wasn't traditional Spanish tomato bread. The octopus was good in itself but served on a huge bed of very overwhelming romesco sauce. It needed maybe 6-8 dots of that sauce along the rim, but the sheer volume of that very strong sauce just overwhelmed the delicate octopus. Each dish that was laid in front of us was so poorly presented and ""off"" from the beauty and unctuousness of what nice tapas should be and used to be here.  The only good dish was a jamon and manchego on a roll- like a little sandwich.

Jordan C.,3/24/24 2:25,0,0,0,0,5,"My mom and I came here on a Saturday night for a nice dinner on our way home from Williamsburg. Mas Tapas has been in Charlottesville for a while and is very highly regarded. The menu consists of tapas and Spanish styled food. You can order the food in a tapas size or a racion size, which is double the size of the tapa serving. We ended up splitting a variety of tapa dishes and left comfortably full. The interior is fun with an abstract flair to it. The service was busy, could have been more attentive. We didn't have a reservation and were lucky to get one of the last spots available at the bar. We both enjoyed eating at the bar and it allowed us to see them preparing all the dishes!

We ordered several things at once and they came freshly prepared and were served straight from the chefs. They were also spaced out nicely, we didn't receive everything at once but we didn't have to wait too long in between the tapas either. The jamon y queso came first which was a plate with ample amounts of jamon serrano reserva and manchego cheese. You can never go wrong with high quality meat and cheese, and this certainly didn't disappoint! The meat was similar to a prosciutto and paired magically with the sharp manchego cheese. The ensalada lechuga came next and it included baby lettuces, toasted pine nuts, sultanas, manchego cheese, and a mango vinaigrette. The salad was simple and light, but had great flavor, especially from the tangy mango dressing. After the salad, the coliflor arrived. It was cauliflower roasted with coconut milk, ginger, turmeric, and grey salt. Probably some of the most flavorful cauliflower we've ever eaten. The turmeric was delightful and added a complexity to an otherwise boring vegetable. The aueso y alcachofa and papas bravas arrived next. Both these dishes were absolutely amazing. The potatoes were cooked to perfection, with slightly crisp skins and a soft, fluffy interior. They were roasted with harissa and herbs, topped with a garlic aioli. The harissa added a slight spiciness to them and the creamy garlic aioli complimented the heat very well. Highly, highly recommend. The queso y alcachofa plate was a spinach artichoke like dip with roasted artichoke hearts, sweet onions, garlic, herbs, and goat cheese, served with their house made bread. This was outstanding! The goat cheese elevated the flavor of the artichokes so much and added some tang to it. The bread was heavenly and was perfect for serving the dip on. We decided to order a couple more items, included the lamburgeusa and the carne asada. The lamburguesa was a lamb and beef slider with feta, salsa especial, baby lettuces, served on a brioche roll with pickled veggies. The was a super flavorful slider and the brioche bun was downright amazing. The feta cheese was strong, but complimented the flavorful meat and sweetness of the bun. Last was the carne asada, arguably the most impressive tapa we had! The carne asada was grilled extremely rare to perfection, served with a duck fat tortilla topped with a herbaceous mojo verde sauce. Words cannot do justice for how perfectly cooked this steak was and just how much flavor it had. It was tender, with a nice char. The sauce overtop of it only amplified the flavor of the steak. We did end up ordering their chocolate sangria torte. It was essentially a flourless chocolate torte with a sangria flavor to it. The sangria was subtle, but present, and the raspberry coulee worked nicely with the richness of the chocolate. A great way to finish our amazing dinner!

All in all, we left full, very impressed, and more than satisfied! Everything we ordered had immense, unique, bold flavors that left us wowed. Each dish was different from the next and portioned perfectly. You can tell they really prioritize using high quality ingredients and it reflects in the flavors of the food. The restaurant has a cool vibe to it with pops of color and abstract art. While the service could have been more attentive, it wasn't poor.

Alexander S.,7/7/24 14:58,0,0,0,0,2,"Mas fell as flat as their 50 dollar Sangria. This used to be one of our favorite restaurants in Charlottesville, but it has fallen on hard times.

The Sangria was 50 bucks. Not a typo. Not 15 bucks. It tasted like a 5 dollar bottle of bad red wine with a few slices of fruit. Traditionally, a little brandy is added or sugar or something to bring out the flavor or liven it up. We ordered a little ginger ale to keep it from tasting like flat cheap wine

The olives were serviceable.

The bread and Machego was a half loaf of dry baguette and two pieces of manchego sliced like American cheese.

The atun(tuna) and arugula was similarly bland. Needed salt and some lemon may have helped.

Papas bravas is usually a staple of Spanish tapas. Roasted fingerling potatoes with an aioli or other sauce. Their variant had spicy harrissa sauce and aioli and might have been a good dish... If they remembered to add any salt. We asked our server for a small bowl of coarse sea salt or finishing salt. That little pinch made a huge difference.

Next was albondigas with romesco. This is meatballs with a pureed red pepper and garlic sauce, or it should be. We received the tiniest dried meatballs which were clearly overcooked. The were served in a thin oily gravy that bore little or no resemblance to romesco.

The datil or dates wrapped with bacon, lacked both the saltiness or the sweetness whose combination generally make this a favorite

The grilled pulpo(octopus) had thin caliber pieces with a rubbery texture. Again, the dish lacked salt and that necessary lemon, which might have brightened it up and brought out the flavors better.

The restaurant was not crowded but service was substandard. Nobody asked how the food was nor did they make the appropriate number of inquiries to see if we needed or wanted anything else.

I have been to Mas many times in years past. The food this time was disappointing one dish after another.

Kate C.,7/20/24 23:55,0,0,0,0,2,"Two stars for good service but the tapas were a big miss for us. The meatballs were dry, we had a couple cold patatas bravas, and everything else felt average or below average. It's definitely a cheap option in the area but if you're a big fan of tapas, this place will probably miss the mark for you.",794,75,xt1fs9q7MuNU3nSs5hJICA,"Boston, MA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xt1fs9q7MuNU3nSs5hJICA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/zhx9HrJ-FbOCqhZVj0vW-A/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mas-tapas-charlottesville?hrid=
