2007-09-09,1.0,"There's a mad rush in cville to cash in on the upscale restaurant trend, and this restaurant seems to have rushed a little too quickly.  The food was really good, and really pricey, but the service was HORRIBLE.  First, you don't give a new waitress an 8 person table outside when the restaurant is 25 yards away and upstairs.  Second, the waitress forgot 4 different food orders, and would have forgotten more if we hadn't reminder her.  Third, she was slow as a snail getting all of our drinks and coming back to check-in on us.  Finally, they include 20% gratuity for parties larger that 6.  We had no way to give her any feedback because she automatically got an extremely generous tip from us.  

I went and spoke with the manager about the situation, more as constructive feedback than as ""I'm so angry and want free dessert"", and she seemed to appreciate it.  As I sat down after talking to her, the waitress came up to our table and said ""I'm sorry you've had such an unpleasant evening"".  Instantly, everyone felt bad that she was so upset, but at the same time, that is so awkward for her to say anything at all.  She looked like she was crying too...

So to make matters worse, the manager was tactless enough to reprimand the waitress while we were still seated.",469.0,Ten Sushi
2008-06-07,1.0,"My singular worst dining experience I have ever had. The atmosphere is sophisticated & modern, the fish is extremely great quality but the overshadowing problem is the service is abysmal.

Dining on a holiday weekend the two of us were perfectly comfortable dining at the sushi bar. Unfortunately your seats are below the height of the workspace so you can't actually watch the chef work.  Our waiter was unhelpful in making suggestions and only made vague pretentious statements to my date to ""dive into the menu"".  The snobby attitude continued to the runners who dropped plates off at the shortest point to walk than putting the dish front of us. I realize the kitchen was busy but 2 of my items arrived before the edamame my date ordered. When I asked when my date's selections were coming out the waiter dismissed my question. The second time we expressed our surprise at how long it took for edamame to arrive the waiter realized he had not put in the order. The third time we asked and our waiter told a runner the runner looked straight at my date and rolled her eyes.

For $62, we ordered a salad, 2 small sticks of garlic meat, 2 small sticks of chicken citrus, a very good toro, and they still billed us for the edamame that never arrived. When we called the waiter over to show him he didn't even know it had never arrived. I left the free chocolate dessert in disgust.",62.0,Ten Sushi
2008-10-20,5.0,"I just love this place way too much to not give it a full 5 stars.  I got to go back this past weekend and service was much better.  I was sad to see they had changed their Specials menu and I was without my Lucky 7 roll.  Everything else was just as delicious as I had expected though.  

Thanks Ten!",107.0,Ten Sushi
2008-10-11,4.0,"I've only ever been here for drinks, so stay away from me if you need an honest critique of the food.  However, the bartender told me they were lowering a lot of their menu prices in lieu of recent turmoil, so it is just the time to check out a place you know you've been curious about.
As far as lounging and drinking , this is a great spot on the downtown mall.  
The decor is pretty unique and original, and not just in a ""this is a town with only 50k people what do you expect"" sort of way, but in a ""hey, I'd even hang out here in midtown"" sort of way.
Delicious array of sakis, some of which are served in traditional cedar boxes are a nice touch, as are the comfortable couches next to ridiculously large windows overlooking the action on the downtown mall.",283.0,Ten Sushi
2009-11-11,2.0,"Disappointment with a capital 'D'.

Now, I'm not normally a 2-star rater, but this is definitely all Ten is worth.  This place came highly recommended, so I expected to be blown away, but instead was completely turned off.

The service was so bad I am embarassed and ashamed for them.

We were celebrating a very special milestone birthday for a close friend, and when I told the waiter he just looked at me blankly and said, 'Oh' (as in 'Oh, big deal').  There was no comp'd drink or free dessert or anything.  Our bill came to a whopping $271.08 and not even one measly free edamame pod??

Another problem we had with our waiter is that we complained about the stupidly expensive wild sashimi platter (Omakase) we had which HE had recommended - it was so below average and we were very unimpressed.  We asked him several times to relay our message to his management and/or the sushi chef.  His response was, ""My roommate is the sushi chef, I'll tell him later"".  I should have told him we'd pay him ""later"", then.  If there's ever a place I wanted to do a dine-n-dash, this was it.

I should mention that the calamari appetizer was delicious, and the crab sushi roll was fairly tasty.  Everything else was meh.

Get your act together, Ten.  Hip decor does not fool me.  This place is sub-par and not just for us West Coast sushi snobs.",76.0,Ten Sushi
2010-01-10,1.0,"I'll carry on the trend, but yes, Ten is overpriced.  $15 for a spicy tuna roll is absurd, but I pay absurd prices when it is justified by extreme deliciousness, fabulous service, and outstanding atmosphere.  None of those three elements were met, and thus, there is absolutely no reason to check out Ten.  

We arrived at 6:15 on a Tuesday evening.  The restaurant was almost empty.  There were 2 tables set to accommodate larger groups (6+) but the remaining 7 booths in the front of the space were empty.  We were sat at a small table that is awkwardly set between booths and in front of the waiters' computer and when I asked whether we could sit in one of the many empty booths we were told no, that they were planning on being too busy.  This was upsetting enough, but I thought that maybe there was something I was unaware of.  Nope.  By the time we left maybe 75 minutes later the restaurant was just as empty as when we arrived.  I should have just walked out when we were told No.  Alas, we didn't.

Besides the maitre d, the server was friendly enough.  No real complaints there.  And the food was fine.  Not even close to worth the price.  Even a simple cucumber roll is $5 (a tool by which I often measure the priceiness of sushi restaurants.  Even my favorite hoity toity DC sushi place only has $4 cucumber rolls).

Anyway, the maitre d's attitude put a sour taste in my mouth and none of the food was delicious enough to remove it.  I'd look for a different sushi joint if I were you.",60.0,Ten Sushi
2011-01-23,2.0,"This place would make a great date night, it has a cute hipster vibe, it's dimly lit, techno playing a little too loudly in the background, and the prices show you care.

We must have gone on an off night though, because the sushi we had was not fresh. Overall, the taste was good, but the tuna had a faint fishy taste, which means that it was getting close to the point of no return.  

This was upsetting, because of how expensive everything is on the menu. We ordered the honey chicken appetizer, and for $6, we got two small pieces of chicken on half skewers. Really? The annoying part was that our waiter didn't seem to think we had ordered enough/spent enough money.  He only checked on us twice during the dinner, and the second time was when we were done eating and if we would be ordering something else (after he recommended that we should probably get another plate of food), when we told him we were done, he walked away looking very irritated and promptly brought us our check. I guess $50 for two people just wasn't enough for him.",242.0,Ten Sushi
2011-02-21,2.0,"You're paying too much for ambiance here---- the food was way overpriced and not THAT good.  the wagyu tenderloin was tasty, but everything else we ordered (skewers, salad, etc) were just ok.  our waiter seemed to be more interested in being good looking and charming than being knowledgeable and/or attentive.
bottom line:  go somewhere else!",35.0,Ten Sushi
2012-03-06,4.0,"Ten is underrated on Yelp. The food is fresh, and the staff is really helpful. The menu is big, with lots of options for people who like sushi, and those who don't. The staff accommodated our large group, and our waiter was so helpful for my pregnant sister, who loves sushi, but can't eat anything raw right now. They were also helpful in finding an appropriate meal for a two year old, who ended up loving his rice and fish. My personal favorite was the avocado tempura, but everyone loved their dinners. 

This restaurant could do well in any metropolitan area. The only criticism I have is that the decor is a little outdated. The restaurant is a bit dark (the whole room feels grey/blue), and it feels less friendly than it should. With a little update, the restaurant would be charming, as well as so tasty!",13.0,Ten Sushi
2013-02-21,1.0,"I was going to give Ten a 2-Star rating, because for as bad as my experience was, the food was marginal, but I couldn't do it.

That being said, the interior looked nice and anything good I have to say about Ten will stop there. 

Ten can jack up their prices because they have the best fish in Charlottesville. Sadly, that isn't saying a whole lot. I've paid $10+ for the standard 2 piece nigiri selections once in my life somewhere in Beverly Hills, and for as good as it was, it still hurts to pay that much. But $10 for two pieces of salmon? In Charlottesville? If the fish was monstrous I might not have been as annoyed, but it was your average sized piece of sushi.

It was my fault that I didn't look more carefully at the online menu disclaimer stating that the price was per piece and not for a two piece serving, so when I got there with my parents to treat them to dinner, I was caught off guard and couldn't work up the nerve to get up and find someplace else to eat after we'd already been seated and looked at the menus. I probably should have.

For me, the decent quality of the food merited at least three stars. The pricing dropped it down to two. The staff nuked it into a one.

I was coming back from the bathroom after I had washed my hands before the meal and two of the servers were standing in the doorway that leads into the kitchen area in the hallway with their backs to me. This is what I hear:

""You can have the Asian table""
""F**k that, and get no tips? It's your turn anyway.""

The guy that tried to hand us off was midsentence responding when they saw me walk by.

Bill came out to over $200 for just nigiri with no alcohol, I left zero tip for that idiot. My dad and I each ate a burger at Five Guys because we were still hungry.

Never going again.",59.0,Ten Sushi
2013-09-03,4.0,"Review's only for the separate lounge area and the delicious sake mojito with giant chunks of ginger; I can't say anything about the food, only that the portions looked tremendously tiny, the presentation was pretty, and I'm sure everyone leaving still had growling stomachs. I've been spoiled rotten by too many all-you-can-eat sushi places in New York, and short of miracle fatty tuna, I can't justify to myself shelling out $10 for a measly few pieces. It really is too bad that Charlottesville is stupidly land-locked, and this place has pretty much got the fish market cornered; I can count on one hand the (good) Japanese restaurants in town. I had already lined my stomach plenty before coming and wanted to get my alcohol on, but let me just say something first about the ambiance of this place: 

First, you're totally paying for the gorgeous 30-foot high ceilings, the cascading light display they've got next to the bar, and the quiet hush that comes when people are trying not to think about how much money they're eating. Second, I want to design my dream home's bathrooms after their bathrooms here. Minimalist Zen. 

FYI - you can't sit in the booths or at the tables without ordering some food. I like how they set up a lounge area but it's still quite tiny and when we left around at around 10:30 on Friday, it had gotten quite crowded. One $10 mojito was good enough for me. Heard good things about the magenta Setting Sun drink. Our waitress was so nice - she offered to split our six-party bill before we asked.

Free Chinese lesson of the day: the little character they have on top of ""TEN"" means sky or heaven. You're welcome. Feel free to impress your date with that.",1420.0,Ten Sushi
2013-03-21,3.0,"Ten is okay. Ten is fine. Ten is a so-called fancy dining establishment downtown that has pretty ridiculous prices. It could be a good reason for girls to dress up and gossip. But if you're looking for a big hearty meal respectable of your money's sweat and tears, turn around. 

I agree with most of my fellow Yelpers here, sushi quality is not anything out of this world. 

Coming here with a possible love interest is nice, on group dates though? Not so much.  

My date and I ordered off a special dinner menu, which provided the option of a three course meal for $30 each. Every dish presented was supplied with a quantity suitable for a baby. These appetizers and entrées were also on the original menu, but because they put it on a separate sheet of laminated paper and deemed it as an ""exclusive offer,"" they could legitimately cut down on the portions. Sushi, again, was so-so. Where your money goes to is the aesthetics, but given, taste was not bad either, quite tender for meats. During the dinner, my boyfriend has the tendency to joke around with me, hinting at the idea of me footing the bill. I honestly don't mind, but it's ironic when he lightly hits my hand when I try to grab the check. Points for humor and chivalry. Details, ladies. 

Explanatory summary: after what was one of the most memorable nights of my life, we scurried back to our dorms where my boyfriend had to make ramen to quench the growling that persisted. Before I passed out on the bed, I heedlessly noted to myself that the food experience is what matters, good or bad. I will simply and properly feed myself the next morning instead. No harm done.",21.0,Ten Sushi
2013-03-22,4.0,"Ten is without a doubt the best sushi you can find in Charlottesville! You might accidentally walk right past it the first time because there is just a small door to a stairway that leads up to the main restaurant. 

The skewers aren't worth the money in my opinion. The waygu beef skewers are cooked nicely, but the chicken can be overcooked and the portions are pretty small. For those who are looking for a non-seafood option, try  the wagyu tenderloin topped with truffled herb wasabi butter. My sister hates sushi so she chose the steak instead and it was really flavorful and tender. Other than the tenderloin, I have found their other non-sush options underwhelming. 

The sushi is very fresh here and what I really love about Ten is that they use freshly grated wasabi! I don't usually use much of the green blob that's usually served with sushi, but the fresh wasabi has a wonderfully different flavor that goes so well with the fish. They have plenty of specialty rolls which have never disappointed. My top picks include their rainbow roll, soft shell crab roll, and dragon [eel] roll. 

I think that they're sushi prices are reasonable and comparable to what you would find in D.C. Since they don't have much competition, they are probably not pressured to keep prices low. 

Service used to be awesome here--the waiters were professional and super personable. Over the years, I feel like their service has become spotty and a little inconsistent. For example, the last time I visited, our waitress was impersonal and seemed a little flustered. I don't know if she was just having a bad night or what--- but it resulted in a slightly awkward experience.

2013-10-06,5.0,"I've been here a couple times. Once a rare date with my wife and another for my daughter's 25th bday. My only regret is we went to Clifton Inn for one of our other daughter's 21st in February before we knew about this place. You can see my review of the other experience but there's no need to speak of it now.

Ten is lovely. Simple yet lush. Understated. The food is creative as are the drinks. The sake selection is large for a ""big city"" joint to say nothing of its peers in Cville.

My default whenever I go to a new sushi spot is the sashimi. A good sushi chef can turn this simple dishi into a opulent, decadent experience. On my first visit, my wife actually tried my sashimi. She had never eaten it before and was curious because of the presentation. She almost ate all my sashimi. 

A very good sushi chef. Very good fish. Quality ingredients and quality chefs mean this isn't a cheap sushi joint. But what you get is excellent and a value.

Beyond the sushi and sashimi, Chef has a varied menu with great daily specials and imaginative creations that will please purists to fusionistas.

But it's not a place - as you can see from some of the reviews - for hipster hopefuls with limited budgets hoping to cop the air of sophistication without truly appreciating or understanding (or affording) what they're doing. It's not a raucous party spot and it's not really good for loud parties.

It's tranquil and interesting. I look forward to many more visits.",44.0,Ten Sushi
2014-08-24,3.0,"So for my husband and I's 7 year anniversary we decided to try 10. We got to restaurant around 6pm on a Saturday. We were asked if we had reservation which we didn't, so since we didn't we were told the only seating was at bar in back or sushi bar, half the restaurant was available. Which I understand the seating might have been reserved but they remained available through the next hour of us being there. There is also no saying reservations required on door to restaurant or web site. 

The staff was friendly and food was good, place is stylish and fun.  We will probably go back with a reservation but they should have walk in seating available even 1 booth and and stand alone table would be sufficient for most couples/groups that walk in, to have no available seating when obviously there is bc they are empty is rude. I can understand if it were completely packed and 2 tables remained open but there were 6 stand alone 2 seat tables and 2 booths vacant the entire time we were there.

2014-09-12,5.0,"If you like sushi and your stuck in middle of nowhere Virginia, this is a good place to visit. 

Visited this place in November with a couple of friends after having a Sushi craving.  We ordered a variety of dishes ranging from appetizers to desserts and the overall experience was good. 

Appetizers: Tried a Ten salad, it was ok, and not worth the 10 dollars. 
Main dish:  Initially I tried different sushi rolls and did not see the value.  Very expensive and were just ok.  After starting to doubt that this place was any good, I got to try Tuna Sushi and this was worth every cent.  Fish was very fresh and of very high quality. 
Desserts: Delicious, the three of us ordered different desserts and all of them were delicious.  Portion size is just right.

Throughout the experience the service was just OK, slow, but the food makes up for it.

Overall, I recommend this restaurant for people looking for the best Sushi in town.  If you do go here dont waste time and money on the sushi rolls, go for the sashimi or nigiri.",401.0,Ten Sushi
2015-08-30,4.0,"We ordered the Chesapeake roll, chicken skewer trio, poke don, tempura avocado, and udon soup. Everything was great except the yuzu chicken skewer tasted like soap. The other 2 skewers were great. 

Other than that the service was great, atmosphere was beautiful inside and out. Definitely recommend.",7.0,Ten Sushi
2015-09-12,5.0,"Ten is one of the best Sushi experiences that I have had in Charlottesville! It is located in a prime part of the town filled with good places to enjoy great food, alcoholic beverages, and of course entertainment.

Since it is located right on the mall off of 2nd Street, parking is a breeze since you can park in the Water Street garage or the Water Street lot. A short two minute walk and vola! Sushi!

The appearance of the inside of the restaurant is very sleek and modern; very inviting and intriguing. In the evening time, it is nice and dark (not too dark, just the perfect brightness level, if you can imagine that). I have taken my lady out here on numerous occasions (she is a sushi lover as well), and she feels the atmosphere and design is romantic, and I have to agree with her.

It features a full bar, booths, tables for larger parties, and small tables as well - perfect for that one-on-one date kind of scenario. 

Each and every time I have had the pleasure of dining here, the staff has been absolutely outstanding. Think polite and professional, and then go up Ten (see what I did there?!) levels from that! Absolutely outstanding! 

In the front of the restaurant, you get to see the sushi chef and his trainee hard at work. Art unfolds in front of your eyes, as fish, other ingredients, and their mouth watering sushi rice all come together to make the perfect concoction of sushi your tastebuds will ever get the opportunity to taste.

The waiters and waitresses are extremely knowledgeable about the menu. You can enter totally clueless in the world of sushi, and leave a walking sushi-pedia of delicious knowledge.

I have literally tried every type of sushi that they have on their menu, and not once have I ever been disappointed. They really are masters of their craft.

Usually when I review restaurants, price can play a factor in determining the overall rating of the establishment. However in this case, it is sushi - for quality sushi you shouldn't expect to get it for cheap or any sort of bargain price. Ten is not a cheap place to eat by any means, but the quality of the food, service, and atmosphere you will be receiving in exchange for your hard earned dollars is well worth it.

If you are looking for bargain sushi that comes no where near the quality of Ten, feel free to go to your local Asian buffet and serve up a plate of that amateur train wreck of a meal they call sushi.

2016-08-16,3.0,"Came again for another fancy date and was honestly rather disappointed with the quality of the fish this time around. Don't get me wrong, the sake (salmon) and other normal cuts of sashimi were still great, but it turns out their sushi chef opened his own restaurant on the downtown mall (Mican), and I'm not sure if the replacement has the same kind of experience with the cuts of tuna. 

Service was great, and the harami miso was still delicious, but the oh toro (very fatty tuna cut) was not the same cut as we had last year (that was melt-in-your-mouth good). I no longer can say I feel that it was worth the $8, though it was still good tuna. Just not oh toro, which made me a little sad.",103.0,Ten Sushi

2017-07-22,1.0,"I don't often leave reviews. But TEN committed attempted manslaughter tonight, so I felt the need to write a small note in response. 

My wife and I booked a table for two for Restaurant Week. We were explicit on the reservation about her severe, anaphylaxis-inducing allergy to both peanuts and tree nuts. We reminded the waiter of the allergy when we arrived, and asked that every dish be checked with the chef to make sure there were no nuts. (I'm free from any such restrictions, but it's a Japanese restaurant, so of course we wanted to share, and in any event, I wasn't interested in ruining a date night by rendering myself unable to kiss my wife). 

First course arrives: beef tartare roll, and very pretty ahi tuna with avocado...and pine nuts. Not listed on the menu, but literally covering the entire dish. I called the waiter over and noted the nuts on the plate. He immediately apologized. We asked if he had actually checked dishes with the chef, and he admitted that while he might have done so for my wife's order, he didn't do so for mine. I ordered a different appetizer and he left. 

I admit, we probably should've just picked up and left at that point. We were feeling really uncertain about whether this place was taking her food allergy seriously. And no disrespect to any of my friends with intolerances to gluten or dairy (restaurants should take that shit seriously as well) but a nut allergy is life-and-death stuff. But we had this date planned, and it was already 8 pm, so we decided the best course of action was to ask to see the manager. 

A few minutes after I inquired at the host station, the manager shambles to our table. ""Hi.""  A blank stare. I thought, ok, maybe they didn't tell him what happened, and so I explained about my wife's allergy and the dish with the nuts.  More blank stare. I said, ""hey, we're not trying to get anyone in trouble, and we're not looking for a handout, we just wanna be sure you're not gonna bring anything else out of the kitchen with nuts in it. It could kill my wife."" The entire response:

""Only use nuts on the salads and that dish. You're fine. I guess I'll double check.""

We never saw him again. 

The waiter gave us a discount essentially amounting to 20% off. Which, again, I'm not here to quibble about. Too many people think one mistake by a server entitles them to a free supper. But I really just don't think this place took at all seriously their obligation to serve food that was safe for their customers. Which should be a baseline thing for any spot taking your money in exchange for a bite to eat, whether it's a greasy spoon or (in this case) an expensive fine-dining spot.  And so we won't go back, and we recommend that you skip it as well.",1.0,Ten Sushi
2017-12-19,5.0,"I CAN'T GET OVER THIS PLACE. Like I can't stress that enough. I still think about it sometimes and could honestly cry. I was amazed from the second I stepped foot in the building. The place is simple, modern, and clean. They have a beautiful setup and bar. I love the atmosphere-- it makes you feel like a million dollars and makes you want to just spend your entire bank account there. 

For the appetizers, I ordered the udon and tiger shrimp. The udon was pretty good but just a tad on the salty side. The tiger shrimp was amazing. The sauce on those shrimp was to die for. It was also served on a bed of seaweed salad which gave it a nice touch. I ordered the wagyu beef roll and the soft shell crab roll. They were both very good. The soft shell crab roll was served in four larger rolls while the beef was in eight rolls. Although this place is on the pricier side, I genuinely believe it's worth it given the service and experience. I would definitely come back and try some of their drinks as well!",196.0,Ten Sushi
2018-01-28,4.0,"Came here for restaurant week, and I came out really on the fence about the meal. On one hand, the food was very good. Besides the ramen (which I will talk about a little below), the flavors were really great. The dishes were executed really well and the service seemed really attentive. The ambiance is great too, with a modern Japanese decor resembling the contemporary fare. For the $35 menu, I thought the portions were good (enough to satisfy your cravings, but not over-fill you) and the menu extensive enough to offer a variety of entree options. I ordered the below dishes:

Kitsune Udon: This udon were firm but chewy and grounded the soup really well. The warm broth had a light, salty, but bold umami flavor. Great appetizer portion that introduced the rest of the meal.

Abura Ramen: For my second noodle dish, I was expecting a similar broth, but Ten's take on this dish includes all of the fixings without a broth to dilute the flavor. The egg was perfectly cooked-firm whites on the outside and a glossy yolk in the middle. The pork had a great chewiness and salty flavor to complement the egg and noodles. What really stood out was the mushroom and tomago paste on the side. Incorporating these in with the noodles elevated the dish and added a creamy but light base to the ramen. The noodles themselves were very good, but still tasted a bit dry and disconnected with the dish. Even when you incorporate the pastes and the yolk, I would recommend adding a light sauce (other than the oil currently there) to round out the plate.

Nigiri Omakase: this dish was really good. The plate includes 4 nigiri hand chosen by the chef (these change daily). If you can order the Walu, this one was by far the best. The quality of each fish is spectacular and really showcased the knife, preparation, and plating skills of the chef. My only recommendation is to cut down on the amount of wasabi in each piece. I really like having the kick to balance out the butteriness of the fish, but in at least two of the pieces, the wasabi definitely took away from the delicate flavors.

Overall, I'm happy with my experience at Ten. The dishes were simple but well seasoned and executed. Ten uses really fresh ingredients, which brings out complex flavors without over thinking the dishes. Would definitely come back to try more maki rolls and modern entree items.",101.0,Ten Sushi
2018-04-02,5.0,"I'm speechless. My recent experience at Ten was incredible. From the food, atmosphere, to the service- everything was on point.

When you first enter the door, there is a staircase right in front of you (staircase to heaven filled with amazing food). The staircase is pretty long and can be difficult to walk on with heels- just a warning. Once you get upstairs, you see beautiful lights along the wall. The ambiance of this place is super classy and romantic. This place is perfect for date nights. 

My date and I ordered several things to share including: 
-Udon: The best udon I've ever had. It was so light and savory. The noodles were super soft yet chewy.  Also, my favorite thing about this dish was that it was piping hot which was great on a cold night.
-Unagi Sansho: This roll came with freshwater eel, Japanese peppercorn, and unagi sauce. It was so simple yet so delicious. The unagi was well seasoned and paired well with the peppercorn. Dip this in some soy sauce with wasabi and you've got a party in your mouth.
-Soft-shell crab roll: The roll's presentation caught my eyes. As for the taste, equally as appealing. The soft shell crab was crunchy and just the right level of saltiness. Definitely give it a try!
-Tiger Roll: It included prawns and unagi with a spicy sauce. The prawns were so meaty. This roll is worth trying! 
-Japanese Wagyu Beef Roll: MY FAVORITE. I cannot stress enough about how good this was. The beef was incredibly tender and well seasoned- it paired perfectly with the avocado. It just melted in my mouth. Oh my goodness, I still dream about this dish everyday. Just wow. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend this restaurant. It's pricey but the quality is so worth it. If you're a huge foodie like me, you'll love this place.",221.0,Ten Sushi
2018-01-03,5.0,"From the moment I stepped up into this aesthetically pleasing area I was greeted by a beautiful and friendly young lady. I was alone, and she was sensitive to that (it's rare to dine alone these days lol), she asked me if I would prefer a table and I appreciated that (most places assume a loner wants the bar). The server was knowledgeable and attentive to my every need. He knew when to come over to my table and when to ask if I needed another drink....BTW: you will be missing out if you don't order a lychee martini.  Another man came to my table to ensure I was attended to and it felt good. The chef's recommendation for sea bass (and a salad) is what I ordered. I thought I had the best sea bass (Chilean) in Miami, but no...this place has the BEST sea bass dish. service and food both exceed 5     !!

2018-03-17,3.0,"I went to Ten for a Friday night dinner date. 

Pros: Sophisticated ambiance, knowledgeable waiter, good Sake options.

Cons: Very expensive, some dishes have farm-raised fish, appetizer and dessert portion sizes do not justify the $$$. 


Ten gets an A+ for ambiance. The dim lighting, background music, upstairs location on the downtown mall, sleek grey booths, and high ceilings give the restaurant a cosmopolitan feel. The interior of the restaurant is one of the most sophisticated in Charlottesville. Perfect setting for a chic date or girls night out.

The food is very good but not outstanding. Considering the high price point of this restaurant, I expected more. Honestly, the sushi was of similar quality to other (much more affordable) Japanese restaurants that I have visited. 

For our appetizer we ordered the rock shrimp. Half of the shrimp was coated in a spicy creme sauce and the other half in a sweet wasabi sauce. I highly recommend this for an appetizer order. However, the portion size was small for a $12 order. 

We ordered four sushi rolls for dinner. The Maguro Karai Honey, Stella Blue Crab Roll, Unagi Sansho, and Ebi Tempura. Some rolls have eight pieces while others have six. The sushi was good- what you would expect from a respectable sushi restaurant - but it wasn't stellar. I assumed that the fish would be wild-caught considering the pricey menu at Ten, but the waiter informed me that the crab and shrimp were farm-raised (farm-raised fish are often raised in controversial conditions). This was disappointing. 

For dessert we ordered the green tea mochi and warm chocolate cake. I would recommend the warm chocolate cake. The vanilla ice cream compliments the warm inside of the cake. 

For drinks, I recommend getting a Sake flight and then ordering a glass of your favorite kind. Our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable about the different Sake options. I enjoyed my glass of the ""Little Lily"" Sake.",20.0,Ten Sushi
2018-09-04,5.0,"Ten is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlottesville. Throughout my 4 years in Charlottesville, I have probably been to this restaurant at least 7 times. The restaurant itself is very elegant and it is located on the Downtown mall which always opens up the opportunity of taking a night stroll after our stomachs are stuffed from the excellent food. 

Service: The staff is always incredibly friendly and super knowledgeable. They are always willing to share with you their favorite dishes and are never trying to upsell you on anything -- in fact, I remember our waitress during restaurant week actually giving us advice on what the most cost effective deals were. 

Food: I am a huge fan of their rolls -- they are always very unique, with some rolls including ingredients like jalapenos in them or even the standard components such as soft shell crab. Whatever ingredients they put in their rolls, they are always of the highest quality. Aside from rolls, some of my favorite dishes include the Wagyu tenderloin (melt in your mouth beef that is packed with flavor) and the Walu fish sashimi (also a melt in your mouth white fish). Definitely visit during restaurant week -- they have an awesome value deal that allows you to try many dishes for a much cheaper price, and you definitely leave feeling very full! 

I'll miss this place when I graduate!",31.0,Ten Sushi
2018-12-05,5.0,"YES. AMAZING. 

My boyfriend and his family are regulars here. He took me for the first time when I visited him in Charlottesville. Coming from the SF Bay Area where I eat tons of sushi, this was one of the best I've had. 

The lobster tempura was INCREDIBLE. SO DELICIOUS I'M TEARING UP THINKING ABOUT IT. Even though everything wasn't 5-star perfect this tempura impelled me to give Ten a full five star rating. It was THAT good.  

The rock shrimp tempura was also good but a little too heavy. 


We got the tempura shrimp sushi rolls and the crab rolls. The crab rolls were spectacular. Tasted like mini crab cakes. The shrimp tempura was again a little too heavy with the sauce. 

We got edamame for appetizer. Very good. 
The seaweed salad was also SO DELICIOUS. second favorite thing of the night after lobster tempura. Red miso s

The green tea had a very unique earthy taste that I really enjoyed. 

The service was slow to get our main dishes to us but they took the appetizers off the bill to compensate which was nice.",171.0,Ten Sushi
2018-09-06,3.0,"Coming from the perspective of someone from Las Vegas, accustomed to sushi there, in LA, and Japan itself, Ten is just alright. In a sense, it's not their fault, theres only so much Charlottesville restaurants can do not being immediately connected to any big cities receiving fish imports. For their means, they do a great job, the tuna always tastes fine, but I've had some others that have been chewy or fishy. They are also rather expensive because they do do the best they can to bring in fish. It is the only place I would ever go to get sushi in Charlottesville, but still couldn't bring myself to do it often. Decent cocktail selection! Love the lychee.",98.0,Ten Sushi
2018-07-15,3.0,"My first restaurant in Charlottesville!! Aaaand it was just OK haha. The ambiance is lovely; really clean and modern, with high ceilings and windows. Bathrooms are nice too, which is always a big plus. 

The food I wouldn't go out of my way to come back for. Overall, everything was mediocre, and a couple dishes had added flavors that I did not care for. We ordered three courses from the Restaurant Week menu, those being the unagi don, torotaki, and shrimp rock tempura. The unagi don was definitely the worst thing we ordered; you don't really need to add much to sushi rice and well-cooked, good-quality unagi. But for some reason... they found the need to add a sort of ume seasoning in the form of furikake. It was weird. Like, the rice and thus the dish overall took on a sourer flavor that overpowered the normally fabulous, sweet taste of unagi. So that was mildly upsetting. The rock shrimp was certainly unique; it looks like tater tots, and the breading is thinner and softer. I personally prefer that, as there's more room for the actual shrimp. The torotaki was fine -- six pieces -- and tasted simple and relatively fresh. Can't say that the toro tasted special or far better than regular tuna, which is usually what I look for when I order toro. 

We also ordered three rolls -- the blue crab, the sake, and the rainbow -- and the Ten salad. The Ten salad combined some very strange vegetables, and overall I don't think they were very fresh, as some of the lettuce was way too bitter. The rolls had way too much mayo dolloped on top, which is a signal (to me) of over-Americanization of fresh, Japanese flavors that ought to be allowed to shine through on their own without being totally smothered by sauce. I also think the presentation was lacking... especially taking the classy ambiance into consideration. It was a tad messy. 

LASTLY, the wasabi was SO dulled down, and it was a weird color. And there was very little of it. 

Overall a totally lackluster experience -- though I am quite particular when it comes to Japanese food. I love the atmosphere and would maybe come back for just drinks, but no way would I recommend the place on the merit of their food alone.",42.0,Ten Sushi
2018-07-27,5.0,"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing atmosphere and location. 

My group came in not knowing anything -- our waitress ran us through everything,  and was incredibly pleasant to boot. We ended up going with the honey roll, the sake roll, and the wagyu beef roll, with an udon appetizer. All of our food came very promptly despite it being decently busy.

The udon came out very heavy on the salt, but the waitress provided us with hot water to dilute it almost immediately. All of the sushi was fantastic, we demolished it. Wrapped up with a triple sake tasting. I asked the bartender about sake, as I'm planning on visiting Japan this year, and he gave me an entire masterclass session about the sake brewing process, the terminology of each type of sake, and his own recommendations based on the preferences I listed. The sakes were all very interesting; worth trying even if you don't end up loving sake.

To top it all off, Ten is located right on the Downtown Mall in a well-decorated, cozy, and modern-feeling space. While it was a bit expensive (right around $70 including tax), I think it was more than worth it for the experience. 

Highly, highly recommended. I hope to come back to Ten as soon as I can to try more of their offeings.",9.0,Ten Sushi

2019-11-05,3.0,The quality of the food and drink was good.

2019-05-16,4.0,"I love a good sushi spot - and must say Ten is one of the better places in C'Ville to satisfy your sushi craving.  My first interaction was for restaurant week where we tried the beef tartare roll, the hamachi, and the omakase nigiri.  Everything was excellent and fresh!   I will say however, that you do pay the primo prices for a spot like this - so just be prepared!

The other occasions that have brought me here have been for a quick bite before a show at the Paramount or Jefferson.  They do offer a happy hour, but only at the bar and lounge area, which is first come first serve.  I have enjoyed sake flights here on multiple occasions that have been refreshing and delightful.

We kicked off the meal with Wagu beef skewers which were delicious in a scallion wasabe topping. Next was the Tuna roll and 4 sushi selections. Just enough and artistically displayed on your plate.

Went to Ten for a date night on Friday night and scored a table without a reservation. Although the downtown mall was hopping, I think Ten gets overlooked because it is upstairs. We were seated in the back bar ""day"" themed area, but I'd recommend asking for the front section ""night"" themed area if possible. We had a great waitress and excellent service throughout the night. We came for a sushi night, but specifically because they had numerous vegetarian options. Everything was great - we got veggie tempura, avocado tempura, avocado roll, cucumber roll, and the two other vegetarian rolls (a shitake mushroom based one, and a cucumber/avocado roll with plum sauce). The plum sauce was really floral and unique. We sprung for green tea mochi for desert - it wasn't for us (first time trying it), but I think it was a good version of mochi!

For my main I ordered the soft shell crab roll which was very distinct in that I had never tried anything like it before. It's a warm roll that is served in 4 pieces. I believe the shiso, a Japanese herb, is what granted its refreshing flavor. The other roll I ordered was the tiger roll. 

The service was very quick and attentive as they understood my needs and expectations. Considering I was sitting at a bar, and lacked reservations, I was impressed.",77.0,Ten Sushi

The ambiance and service is great. The quality of sushi is fantastic. The sushi combinations are unique. 

We ordered the:
Lychee Martini - 10/10 (super yummy)
Green Tea - 10/10 

Maguro Karai honey roll - 7/10 (it was very tasty just a bit too spicy for me)
Ebi Tempura - 8/10 
Stella blue crab roll - 7/10 (I don't like this roll, but my fiancé and sister rated it)
Wagyu beef roll - 10/10 (this is my absolute favorite roll here!)
Rainbow roll - 9/10
Dragon roll - 6.5/10 (this roll was disappointing because I usually really enjoy dragon rolls, but their version is bit too leafy)
Negi Toro - 9.5/10 (this is amazing)

2022-10-01,5.0,"TEN out of five stars, for sure! Is this why they named their restaurant so? hehe

ELEGANCE.

Imagine walking up a flight of styled stairs that lead to a dim-lighted restaurant with a sushi bar, exposing all their fresh products. Royalty, much? 

FRESHNESS.

We ordered their toro sashimi and it MELTED into your mouth. Literally the best! We then ordered several rolls: Maguro Karai honey, Ebi tempura, Stella blue crab, Wagyu beef, Rainbow, Dragon, Negi Toro. My all-time favorites I highly-suggest you to order is the Negi Toro and Wagyu Beef. If you are a sPiCy person, Maguro Karai honey will do you some justice too! My least favorite was the dragon roll as it had an odd texture. 

We also tried their lychee martini which was a perfect blend of sweetness and bitter. I do typically order this in any Japanese restaurant because I love lychee and fish combos; although, Ten had the best by-far. Normally, the bartender makes the drink TOO sweet but this person did it perfectly right.

Not only are their plates high-quality, but they also do not make you wait FOREVERRRRR. Their service is quite speedy!

It was so refreshing cucumber vodka drink. Great way to start of the palate. I then ordered the lobster roll which did not disappoint. It's not what I was expecting at first but as soon as the first bite hit my mouth I was sold. It has such a sweet and spicy taste to it. The lobster was amazing in itself. I then ordered the wagyu beef roll. Again not know what to expect but the flavors of the marinade are perfect. The beef just almost dissolves on in your mouth. The avocado and lettuce in the roll topped with the beef was exactly what I needed and didn't know it. I was seriously having an orgasm  in my mouth. I know most people would not even consider this sushi but in my book it is. I def want to come back and try more. As for the ambience it was great for a date night or outing with the girls, but the music is a tad to loud for an empty place. 10/10 highly recommend.

2022-01-26,2.0,"Was very excited to finally make it here last night after hearing many times it's the only good sushi place in Cville 

The atmosphere is very cool. High end vibe for sure. Service was great. Good sake selection. 

Felt like it was going to be a great night when we sat down and started looking over the menu. 

Unfortunately the sushi itself did not live up to the promise of the restaurant design. 

It is simply not good. It's not awful. I've had worse, but nowhere near the level of what good sushi should taste like. 

The Toro tasted old and it was room temperature. Yuck. Other rolls had that ""fishy"" taste that signals the fish is too old or has not been cared for properly in the case. 

Should have seen this coming as I saw other rolls they were placing on the counter get hot beef dumped on top of them. That's a big red flag that this is more about the idea of cool sushi and not delivering actual high quality sushi. 

If you like a cool spot to come with your friends with a high end vibe this is your place.

2022-03-16,3.0,"I was so excited to go back to Ten and write a five star review. I was kind of shocked to see the lower reviews--we went once in early 2021 and had a great time. But now I get it after coming here for my birthday dinner. 

The restaurant wasn't particularly crowded when we got there (~6:30) but definitely filled up by the time we left (~8:30). The server took a few minutes to get to us but promptly took our drink order, but that's where the promptness ended. It took about 20 minutes to get our first drinks. I ordered a sake flight and my husband ordered a beer. We also ordered some edamame. All three came out around the same time. The server came by to check on us and noticed we were low on water. He promised to refill but seemingly forgot, but came back to take our order. They were out of some of the non-sushi options we wanted to try so we decided to just do three sushi rolls: rainbow,sake, and tuna avocado. The server offered my husband another drink it was brought out before our food. When that came out I asked for a glass of sparkling wine. Our food came, we ate it, and 40 minutes later I still didn't have any sparkling wine. It was finally brought just before dessert. The server did take it off the bill, which was kind. But going the entire meal without a drink OR even water was kind of crazy for a place as high priced as Ten. They did give me a great dessert for my birthday which I appreciated but at that point the experience had been a little soured.  The sushi was decent, but not so amazing to overcome the poor service experience. I know everyone in the service industry is understaffed, but please at the very least bring me water! We probably would have ordered more if not for knowing it might take another 45 minutes to get more food or drinks. 

I might give ten another go at some point, but for my 30th next year I'll definitely choose another restaurant.",179.0,Ten Sushi

2022-04-22,5.0,"I've been told ever since I moved to Charlottesville that Ten is incredible, and my expectations were extremely high. Let me tell you, nothing disappointed. The ambiance was amazing, the drinks were strong and delicious, and the food was absolutely mouth watering. They operate in a small plates/ tapas style, so you can place orders at any time and they come out as soon as they are ready. We started with the Tori trio, which was three chicken skewers charred to perfection, topped with unique sauces. My favorite was the spicy honey, which was sweet with just a small kick of heat at the end of the bite. Next, we tried a few rolls: the Ebi Tempura, the Japanese Wagu Beef, and the Soft Shell Crab. All three were delicious, but I recommend the soft shell crab roll the most: the crab was crunchy and super fresh. You also have to try the Wagu Beef in some form. They serve it many ways, but it was super rich, tender, and covered in a delicious teriyaki sauce. Next, we ordered the Ten Hamachi. If you order anything here, order this. The yellowtail absolutely melts in your mouth, and is accompanied by a luxurious ponzu butter sauce. I also tried the Lychee martini, which was a delicious (very strong) play on a bar classic. Last, we got the green tea mochi for dessert. The ice cream was silky, and so addictive. Overall, this was a phenomenal experience. I would recommend getting a reservation because the location is fairly small, and Ten sushi is not one you want to miss!",168.0,Ten Sushi
2022-12-05,2.0,"Terrible dining experience. 
We arrived on time for our reservation. Upon arrival, the hostess informed us that our table was not available yet, and every table was occupied. So, we waited. When a party left, the hostess had to run and make multiple trips to clear all the food, wipe the table down, and set new plates. And whenever new diners would come in, she would have to stop this process to greet them. At this point, there were multiple parties standing and waiting. So after almost 30 minutes, she was able to walk us to our table. We were starving by this point, and it took almost 15 minutes to be greeted by our server. Then, our drinks took over 20 minutes to arrive. 
I am giving 2 stars because the food and drinks were decent quality, and the staff we interacted with were kind and apologetic, but the organization of this restaurant is awful. This place is a nightmare and I do not recommend it.",1.0,Ten Sushi

2022-01-06,3.0,"This was disappointing....looks fancy and delicious but this is deceiving. We ordered four things: Ten, Rock Shrimp, Harami Trio, and the Miso Sea Bass. I'll start with the good: the sea bass was great--cooked perfectly, tasty broth. This is the reason I give it 3 stars. The shrimp was okay--not great, just average. Now for the not so good: the harami was very disappointing--it was so chewy it was difficult to eat. It might have been overcooked or just a very poor cut of meat. Either way, it was unpleasant. Finally, the ten (their signature salad) was simply gross. The greens were wilting and some had actually turned bad. We were baffled how they could serve this. We asked them to take it off the tab and they did. Everyone deserves a second chance so we might return to try something different. However, I sure hope they provide a better experience if we decide to come back.",10.0,Ten Sushi

Tastes like any other eel roll I've ever had. The hamachi with ponzu butter? You can only taste butter and no other flavors (including the fish). So, mediocre food. Service was pleasant but SLOOOOOW. Waited 15 minutes for drinks, had to chase someone down for the check. One of the chefs had a shirt on that said ""I hate it here.""

Ten is generous with size of the fish for the omakase compared to other omakase places that I have visited and the various fish that we did sample tasted fresh and buttery. We also tried the Japanese Wagyu beef roll which was alright but I don't think I would get it again. The wagyu was soft and rich but the experience eating it reminded me of a teriyaki rice bowl, I think I just prefer getting fish with my sushi and rolls. Additionally, the wagyu roll was rolled poorly and would break apart immediately when we tried to pick the pieces up with our chopsticks which made it hard to experience the flavors from the roll and the beef together. The Hotate roll was much better and rolled properly. Their lychee martini is definitely on the stronger end. I would recommend opting for the omakase / nigiri if you were to try out Ten but we were disappointed by the lack of attention regarding clean plating as one of my friend's soy sauce dish had an oily residue on it.",201.0,Ten Sushi

As for the food, every dish is unique in its own way, but the commonality of freshness that you won't get anywhere else. You can tell it has been handled with care and love. And even on the 'cheaper' dishes, they do not skimp out on the portions such as the tempura lobster and cuttlefish. The sashimi was exciting because we didn't know what we were getting but knew it was going to be delicious.

They ran out of another flight so we got this one instead. Out of the three, our favorite was the okunomatsu. It was the lightest smoothest one on the palette. For an appetizer we got the aburi saba because we love mackerel and it was delicious! There were some seaweed it seemed like at the bottom and it really made the dish. We also got the negi toro and that was my least favorite. I wanted to have toro so thought it would be nice to get an additional piece of it but I didn't know it would be minced toro. Compared to the other dishes, it wasn't that special and I don't think I will order it again because it was kind of lacking but it was a nice change in flavor since it has seaweed. 
The main star of the show was the omakase 20 piece sashimi. It was very filling and every single piece of fish was quality. It tasted very fresh and they all had different distinct mouthfeels so it was such a wonderful tasting experience trying all the different pieces. We also ordered an additional piece of uni because it was a special occasion. We had originally ordered 2 pieces but they were running out and so we got the last piece.

It's kind of sad and pathetic when you wait a few hours anticipating to order online at 5pm (opening time), but online orders via their website for any of their items say ""not available"" or ""ordering online is currently disabled. Please contact the restaurant to place the order"" and when you do, they drop your call and take 6 calls before they answer. The host said verbatim ""Sometimes we do takeout but not tonight because we are busy"". This person did not know why there is no consistency in online orders as to when it's available or when it's posted as unavailable, when asked. The answer is *never* based on looking at their social media. 

Please do not consider yourself a ""modern Japanese cuisine"" that prides themselves on being a landlocked sushi restaurants that curates fresh fish from the coast if you cannot provide your consumers the courtesy or notice that there is no online orders in advance. 

I completely that your establishment may be fully booked, but when someone as myself who usually ventures to this establishment *in person* cannot, and when my wife asks for quality sushi and she just delivered a baby but she gets disappointed, it's a shame. While this may be a one time thing for us, you just really need to do better communicating that there are no online orders before the restaurant opens. Period.

2013-10-07,5.0,"On only my second visit to the University of Virginia's campus I had an expectation of finding that special UVA haunt where all the college students and professors alike can hang out and share stories over a cold brew.  Not just any place mind you, the atmosphere needed to be unique, cozy and that vibe... well you would only know it when it occurred.  Eureka!!! this is indeed the place and I would recommend The Virginian Restaurant all day long for those wanting the same type of experience.

The wait on a Friday evening was not long, but keep in mind there is not a lot of room to wait.  The manager quickly took my name and gave expectations of a estimated wait time.  There is one bench toward the entrance of the place.  Outdoor seating is also available and awesome for nice weather and being among all the foot traffic. All the tables were wooden booths and bar seating was available too. Not a lot of room in the walk way beside the tables, so keep this in mind if you have any issue with being too cozy.  I LOVED the fact it was this way and it added to the mystique of the place. The restaurant was clean and tables were quickly being bused for patrons waiting.

After about 10 minutes we got a table and a waitress who was new had menus and got drink orders. TV's were all around us for your viewing pleasure. However, I really enjoyed the people watching as we were set by the bar. Our table had chunks of wood chipped out from rowdy college students I suppose. I assume many were this way and I just thought it added to the overall charm of the place. How old were these tables any way... well the restaurant itself it a landmark on campus. Are they original to the 1940's, I am unsure. But the wooden floors, booths and bar was like being in a tavern in old time Williamsburg.

We put in our order, for my son's chicken fingers and my Coal Miner Burger. I also ordered a Pint of Full Nelson Pale Ale during happy hour for a measly $2, which was delicious. Even though our waitress was new she smiled often and was helpful every step of the way. The place was slammed, but you would not have known by her attitude. It did not take anymore than 15 minutes and food was out. We both enjoyed our meals and I was in aw of the taste and price of my burger for $9. The Coal Miner is a 1/2 pounder with bacon and barbecue. It comes with fries too. My son's four large chicken fingers were more than he could handle and they really piled on the fries.  

We struck up a conversation with a couple at the bar about the UVA Football the next day. Yes, you are that close even if seated at a table. They were from Indiana and I too am a native Hooiser. We both had the same thoughts of the restaurant. This is the place if your wanting a nostalgic venue for the many a student who have passed through the front door of The Virginian before you.

Eateries like this are a treasure to find. Engagements occur here regularly, secret societies on campus have activity here, and regular folks like me just breathe this all this in.

The Virginian with it's reach history and tradition of serving quality food and beverages in a cozy atmosphere lives on at the University of Virginia.",2669.0,Virginian

I had a ridiculous time at this bar. It was a good mix of us, probably 3 or 4 Tech alums and 3 or 4 UVa alums. I don't remember all that happened, but I know the bartender that was working was the man. He let us take control of the music after 11 PM and get up on the tables and dance. 

I didn't get any food so I can't judge the place on cuisine, but the drinks were stiff enough and everyone was friendly. Next time I'm back in Charlottesville I'd love to come back here and enjoy the night.",473.0,Virginian

2017-07-03,4.0,"I've been here a few times over the last few years due to its proximity to the UVA campus and because of a friend who is absolutely enamored with this place. I've gotten - 

1) The Famous Virginian Club - I've gotten this twice and wow... the portion sizes are huge. It's like 3 pieces of bread with what seems to be endless pieces of turkey, ham, bacon, tomato, lettuce in between... You get to pick a side too (French fries for me). With the amount of food that I got, it felt like I ate enough to last the entire day. Definitely a place with the largest portions I've been to. Come hungry I suppose! 

2) Some sort of salmon burger, which I do not see on their menu anymore. I would not recommend this. I love salmon and thought this was going to be delectable and amazing... WHAT a disappointment.. The salmon was cooked way too long and tasted like a piece of wood.. (okay okay, I have never eaten wood but I imagine it would taste similar).",143.0,Virginian
2017-07-11,3.0,"While on my grad school hunt, I wanted to check out UVA since my parents don't live too far away. We only had a few hours in Charlottesville so we came here for lunch.

Prices were decent with most things being in the $10 and below range. The food was good but the service was a bit messy. Waitstaff seemed disorganized which was bad in a space that was already so cramped. It took a while for us to get  menus and drinks but once our food orders went in the food came pretty quickly. I had a grilled cheese sandwich (there weren't a ton of non-meat options) with tomato and as simple as that is, it was a really good grilled cheese. My stepdad had a steak omelette and said it was good. 

From one college town to another, I feel like every campus has at least one restaurant like this where it's a campus 'tradition' or someplace you have to eat at because of the history or because everyone recommends it. At the end of the day it's just another greasy diner. Not to say it was bad, because as far as greasy diner food goes it was pretty good, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.",240.0,Virginian

2018-02-01,5.0,"I was in Charlottesville this week for business and scored some tickets to the Louisville vs Virginia basketball game. As a huge sports fan, I jumped at the chance and enjoyed a fun game at John Paul Jones Arena. (Yes, the Cavaliers beat Louisville) 

After the game, many of the undergrads told me to head to ""The Corner"" and experience ""UVA Life."" The majority of the people told me to check out The Virginian...or ""The Virg"" as they called it. What a good suggestion.

I stopped in and grabbed a booth and was immediately greeted by Erin, a vibrant, always-smiling 3rd year. She grabbed me a cold Get Bent IPA and suggested several items off the menu. ""We're known for our Mac & Cheese but I love our Coal Miner burger. The Caesar Wrap is good too.""

After choosing the Coal Miner burger, I sat back and enjoyed my beer while watching the undergrads file in along with some other alums and basketball fans for a local bite before the kitchen closed at 10pm.

Hannah was the other server on tonight and she & Erin were a very impressive team. Hannah had a infectious smile and humble attitude that made you want to leave a bigger tip before she even did anything. They are both the epitome of ""good people"" and anyone who has a son in college at UVA is hoping they find a girl like them. Each of them stopped by my table numerous times to check on me and just chat. They answered my questions and shared stories about ""The Virg"" and their experiences on campus as undergrads and also gave me some ""must see"" sights while in town.

The burger was awesome and served exactly as ordered. The first bite was awesome as the bacon was crispy, the burger was juicy and the bbq sauce was Carolina Sweet. Add in the crispy seasoned fries and the Chris Stapleton songs on the speakers made the entire meals more enjoyable. 

Look, there are lots of places in this town you could eat but if you're looking for something other than a fast food burger or a assembly line burrito, do yourself a favor and enjoy the experience of The Virginian in CVille. Just be sure to ask ""are Erin and Hannah are working tonight."" If they are, grab a seat...and consider buying a lottery ticket because you just had some great luck come your way.

2018-02-14,3.0,"This restaurant is conveniently located on the corner at the University of Virginia. I went here for dinner following a basketball game with my dad and my brother. The menu can only be described as classic American food. 

We ordered the grilled cheese, Virginian burger, and the southwest veggie wrap. I appreciated the addition of vegetarian items to the menu. Overall, the food was good and met my expectations. My dad (who ordered the burger) commented that his burger was very tasty. I ordered the southwest veggie wrap, which was also quite tasty, but was a little soggy due to the dressing/veggies. Based on my experience, I'd say go to the Virginian for a high quality burger. They're also known for having dope Mac' and cheese (although, I can't confirm since I didn't try it). 

This place is also great for not only happy hour, but also beer at any time of day. They have great drink specials always. When I was there they were having a 'two for five dollar' deal, which I found as a great deal for quality product. 

Ambiance is best described (in my opinion) as tavern-style. Laid back waiters and patrons (definitely a stop for some drunk UVA students). Not a place to have a quiet, classy meal, but a great place to go watch a game, eat some food, and have a beer.",12.0,Virginian

The Virginian is a classic Corner restaurant that offers a variety of American foods with big portions at generous prices. They also offer fantastic drink specials after 7pm every day that I highly recommend checking out.

I came here with some friends looking to get a few drinks and ordered some appetizers. After taking a glance at the dinner menu, the crab cake entree caught my eye and I decided to turn a late afternoon casual visit into an early dinner. I was not disappointed.

All main entrees come with two sides, so my two large lump crab cakes came with a healthy handful of sweet potato fries and a ceramic cup full of mac n cheese, topped with a crispy hash brown. 

The crabcakes themselves were pretty good, though slightly softer and breadier than what I have had in the past. But at $22, I don't think I can expect a 95%+ crab meat serving. The sweet potato fries were hot, crisp, and lightly salted. The mac n cheese is a side the Virginian is famous for and there is an excellent reason for that. If it fits your diet, always select the mac n cheese as a side. 

All in all, the Virginian offers a wonderful casual dining experience at an affordable price with generous portions. If you're on the corner and looking for a wholesome place to grab a bite with some friends, the Virginian should always be a consideration.",13.0,Virginian

Additional common menu items like quesadillas, burgers, sandwiches, and fries are all served at a higher quality than most competitors, and everything they serve is enjoyable! 

The restaurant is also a well known for its bar, which has different drink specials every day of the week. At night time (typically after around 11pm after the kitchen is closed), the restaurant converts into a full bar.

2018-09-22,1.0,"This seemed to be a great place to go grab a drink. As for the food, my meal was horrible, and service was subpar (at best).

I had the 'famous' mac & cheese as a appetizer. It was very very bland and made me ponder on what was so famous about it anyway???

For dinner, I had the crab cake sandwich. The bun seemed hard / old, the crabcake was properly cooked, but again very very bland. The arugula sauce did not have the kick that one would expect and did not add any enhancements to the flavor profile. With that being said, I had to share mine sauce with someone else at my table as they did not receive their container of arugula sauce with their cab cake sandwich. We would of asked for more but we had to ask for multiple other missing items beforehand, and it was few and far between when we saw our waitress.

For my sides I had fries which were not bad (maybe packaged season fries???)

My other side was french onion soup... I finally figured where they were storing all of their spices!!!!!! They should reconsider renaming this soup as salt onion soup. I LOVE french onion soup and order it almost every time I see it on menu. This is hands down the absolute worst french onion soup that I unfortunately have tried. All you could taste is salt... nothing else.. I could not finish it with fear of having a stroke, and it was just god awful bad.

Then after patiently waiting for our bill (once again feeling forgotten about by our waitress), we asked her to split the bill and kindly told her who had what (because she really did forget). Her world still seemed somewhat rocked having to do this.

She then came back with out respective bills and of course did not have it right. I ended up with all the appetizers. I ended up just paying for them all because I was beyond done with this place by then, and had places to go.

To my understanding this is Charlottesville's oldest restaurant. From older reviews that I read this seemed to once be upstanding place to eat at. I would imagine that either ownership has changed, management, cooking staff, and/or recipes/ingredients... Maybe all of above??? 

Needless to say the only thing keeping this place a float is it's location and bar. As it stands I will never go back for food unless some serious changes are made. So sad....",16.0,Virginian

The hostess/server was very nice and sat us at a booth. My boyfriend got one of the local IPAs that was actually pretty good! For appetizer we got the spinach and artichoke with pita bread and it was really good! The dip was made in house and had a pretty decadent flavor. For our mains I got the grilled cheese sandwich with fries and my boyfriend got their Virginian burger. The sandwich was decent, but a little dry - nothing life changing. Fries were seasoned well. My boyfriend ordered his burger to be medium rare but it came out medium-well. He didn't complain as the burger as a whole was really good. 

I understand the restaurant is a bit of an institution around these parts so by that standard the place didn't really wow us. However, the drinks and food were a great deal for their prices.

The ribs were SO tender and really fantastic. You could barely touch them with your fork and the meat just falls off the bone leaving it flawlessly clean. Delicious!

The mac-n-cheese, which this place is apparently known for, was really underwhelming. It was creamy, but it had almost no flavor. Just tasted like a bowl of creamy noodles, lacking cheesy flavor/boldness, and also didn't have enough salt. The potato cake fritter thing on top was dense and also flavorless - ours tasted overcooked or perhaps not fresh. 
The sweet potato fries were meh. 
The French onion soup wasn't super hot and was just OK.

In hindsight, I should have known better than to order crab cakes... I wonder if people outside of the Chesapeake know what a crab cake is supposed to be?  Crab cakes are shaped like mounds, with discernable - preferably large - chunks of crab inside, off-white in color.  What I received was as if someone thought a crab cake was a hamburger patty made of crab - ground up crab meat (I'll assume it was crab, though I saw nothing that would resemble a lump of crab), flat like a burger of ground meat, gray in color (I have no idea how this even comes to be), slightly charred, and bland.  This is not a crab cake.   This is reconstituted pureed crab.

Moving on, the french onion soup was passable, would have been better with an ample amount of cheese, as it had a deli slice of swiss thrown on top.

Mac & Cheese was fine, not sure why it is famous, and I didn't read the menu carefully enough to know that it was topped with a ""house-made cheddar potato cake.""  At first glance I saw it and thought it was a fried green tomato, but sadly it was not.  I'm not mad at the potato cake, but it did nothing to enhance the mac & cheese, and was like a carb overload.  

On the plus side, service was polite, the atmosphere was buzzing, and ...well... that's it.

Last but not least, when you calculate tip, it should be on pre-tax dollars.  Including the tax in the tip in your suggested tip is dishonest and anyone who doesn't check your math is being ripped off.  

Wouldn't return, but if I did I would not even consider the ""crab cakes.""",501.0,Virginian

2022-04-01,4.0,"The Virginian is a Charlottesville and UVA classic! As a wahoo, my roommate and I frequented the Virg all the time. 

My all time favorite dishes were their Famous Spinach & Artichoke Dip and Stumble Down Mac N' Cheese. Both dishes were fresh and packed with amazing flavors. The meal also went well with a side of their crispy fries. The Famous Spinach & Artichoke Dip is rich and creamy and is perfectly coupled with their house made tortilla chips. My favorite part of the Stumble Down Mac N' Cheese is the jalapeños pepper Jack cheese sauce and the potato pie laid on top of the mac. All together it's a filling and delicious meal! 

Pro tip: if you're looking for a quick for filling snack, get the appetizer sized Stumble Down Mac N' Cheese! 

I highly recommend the Virg in general to anyone visiting UVA or doing a Charlottesville food tour.",181.0,Virginian

The people were nice, ambiance was good (pub style mixed with local diner feel) the max n cheese had no flavor my 12 year old took two bites and didn't even finish. I had Cobb salad with ""grilled"" chicken, the chicken probably came out of a bag as it was a little cold not ""fresh off the grill."" My wife had the tuna ahi salad, my wife NEVER leaves any tuna behind lol, but in this case she gave the tuna an honest try and only ate half; she also said the food had zero flavor.

Took forever getting our drinks and order, then when it did come we asked for mustard and she took care of others before bringing us that for the burger once the burger was half done she brought it. I asked for a coke and my mom a diet and she switched them, no big deal. Then I asked for a regular coke and still brought me another diet. I asked for a regular coke to go and I kid you not she brought me another diet.Had to ask for the bill multiple times and waited as she just ignored us and helped other people. Seemed she was more concerned with other tables then us for whatever reason I guess bc we weren't drinking alcohol. Very ditzy and didn't know anything about the menu.

The Virginian is about what you'd expect for a university-proximate eatery--good beer, fries, and all sorts of other food that probably serves if you eat meat (I don't, but the fries are good). 

The staff set it apart. Every time I've come, Brooke has been friendly, attentive, and found me a seat and a cold drink with alacrity. Alona is charming and stopped by regularly enough to make sure I didn't stay thirsty. They've both recommended good draft beers, cracked a couple of jokes, and made me feel welcome.

No flavor to be found. I felt like I was eating overdone pasta sitting in a cup of milk. So disgusting. I asked my friend if she REALLY liked it and she goes ""well.... Okay it's not great but it's the Virginian! What do you expect!!""

That should tell you all you need to know. People hype it up because it's a more ""exclusive bar"" on the corner (aka hires a bouncer that actually rejects fake IDs) but if you're sober I wouldn't eat here.

Salad is decent.

I heard from a little birdie the burger was quite good so that would likely be my next option. Fries were spectacular though. An incredible amount of seasoning was added... which always gets bonus points for me.

2008-06-12,1.0,"Eh?

I went to college in Charlottesville, VA.  Now, we like to eat down in cville.  I was back in town for a wedding and the rehearsal dinner was there.  
Let me start with the good stuff.  
-Service: They have good service.  They cleared plates and filled drinks fast. They were attentive but not overly hovering.  We had a big group of people but the food came out fairly quick. 
-Cost: Eh.   a little more pricier than most. But, not bad. I'm not sure how much the food actually lives up the place though.

Oh.. wait i'm already going into the bad stuff:
-Food: Dude, seriously the most important thing.  I ordered... Piccata di Pollo con Limone.. aka. Chicken Piccata. It comes with spaghetti in a similar sauce. Honestly, the chicken part of the dish was really good. However... God, I hate spaghetti.  It tasted like plain spaghetti.   Vitello alla Parmigiana  aka Veal Parmagean.... ditto. meat good. bad pasta.  

The salads were okay. You really have to be stupid to mess up salad. 
The ice-cream dessert was okay. Ditto on the stupid thing.
The appetizers... calamari was good. Not overly greasy.  And the bruschetta appetizer was pretty good as well.  

I feel... they fall short.  They have a decent atmosphere... you can watch movies outside and eat dinner, good tablescape and dishes, etc.  The bathroom was so hot, I don't know why they don't have ac in there.  

But, yes.. back to the food. I feel like I'm avoiding it.  

Here's the gist:

If you are a poor college student or your car breaks down in front of the restaurant... then you can go.  If not... go anywhere else. Go downtown ... it's only a few minutes away.  Honestly... I'm a little unimpressed.  apathetic, really.... kind of place where you don't take the leftovers home, but leave it there. 

Sorry, Vivace, better luck next time.

I have always had good service at Vivace and good food to boot.  Because of my food allergies I am unable to eat most Italian food but they've been able to tweak the menu to allow me to dine and the food has always been excellent.  The drink menu is expansive and they have a lot of really nice wines.  

Vivace is a little off the beaten path if you're used to dining in the downtown area, like I am, but that makes it nice because it actually has parking!  They tend to fill up on the weekends so be sure to call ahead and make a reservation if you're going in on a Friday or Saturday evening.",693.0,Vivace

This one night my wife was trying to order a takeout from this place and the gentleman who answered the phone basically said to her in the middle of the conversation ""Ma'am, you are really trying me tonight!"". All because my wife asked to add some pesto sauce to their pasta primavera. My wife had to cancel the order because he was not interested to take the order at all, and he was very OK with it.

We ordered the artichoke and goat cheese dip, orecchiette, and a spaghetti dish with clams that I could not find on the online menu. Shortly after we arrived, warm bread was brought out with individual salt and pepper packets, a small bowl of olive oil, and a small bowl of Parmesan cheese. The artichoke dip was served piping hot and was quite tasty if a little too salty for my taste. Our entrees were served in massive portions and we were only able to eat half of our respective dishes. The clams were fresh and the rest of the dish was quite acceptable. The sauce of orecchiette was somewhat watery and bland, but the pasta itself was cooked perfectly and fresh basil was delectable.

The bruschetta was classic and simple, yet tasty- it came with mozzarella cheese melted in between the toast and tomato. The calamari was also crunchy and tender, the fried peppers tossed in were a nice touch- just wish there were some tentacles mixed in with the rings! For dinner, we shared the prosciutto and arugula pizza and the orecchiette pasta.

If I do return, I will definitely be trying something new or getting the Carbonara or pizza again. They also serve massive portions which I love and hate at the same time.

We have done taken out from Vivace several times during Covid, and visited a couple of months ago and ate outside. This time we decided to eat inside and everything was great. Recognized our reservation, sat us immediately, and the service was all that you would expect and require.  Food was excellent and the timing of appetizers and the meal was good, especially since we knew that it is important for them to turn tables since we are still at 50% capacity.  

Only negative is parking.  I had to circle twice before I parked in a really tight spot on a hill.  On one side UVA is putting up a new building so there is a chain link fence that limits parking, and on the other side there is a strip of stores and since it was a Sunday we thought we could park in the empty lot. However, they had a part-time security guard who politely told us this was off-limits. Seems the ownership of the strip mall is not very supportive of Vivace.  We did find a spot, but when it gets back to 100% capacity I can imagine that parking is going to be a big problem for them.

We ordered three entrees, the gnocchi, carbonara, and the pizza margherita. The pizza was the best of our entrees, it had a great crisp and char that tasted really authentic, if we come back that'll definitely be ordered again. The gnocchi was solid but not excellent, the spinach cream sauce was a very liquid-y cream sauce with some cooked spinach in it. The carbonara had the same problem of very liquid-y sauce. The pastas still tasted pretty good, just weren't the texture we were expecting from the descriptions in the menu. 

The staff was not particularly kind to us when we entered, we asked for a table for three and the staff asked us to wait a moment (which is more than fine), and while we waited they talked amongst themselves. We tried a few times to ask quick questions and were ignored and eventually told to seat ourselves. After we sat down most of the staff sat at the bar and we were able to hear them speaking negatively about customers who had just left the restaurant, which created an uncomfortable atmosphere.

We ordered the calamari as an app ($12) and the orecchiette ($22) as my entree. The sauce was packed with the savory house made sausage and broccoli rabe. It was so delicious, full of umami and the serving was quite large. The sauce filled up the little pockets in the pasta and the ratio of sauce to carb, was perfect for me.

I think I've found one of my new favorite places, so thank you so much for the recommendation! The food was delicious and well priced. Not overly expensive for a nice meal, great ingredients and the service was really good, our waitress was knowledgeable and really made a positive difference.

We sat on the upper patio, but next time we go, we will request the bistro seating which is outdoors and near a large willow tree. I recommend you ask for the table under the willow tree if you have enough time to make a reservation!

I am new to Cville, and Vivace had been my favorite place in the few weeks I have lived here. Tonight, I went after work, after a very long day, looking for good comfort Italian food. I was so looking forward to a relaxing, delicious meal. So, there was no question where I was heading tonight. Vivace! From the moment I sat down, however, the service was pathetic. The servers brought me bread and olive oil -- but no plate on which to eat it. My salad was delicious -- but no one came to clear my plate, even as I watched a nearby table of five being treated like royalty. I waved my hand for five minutes to get someone to take my dinner order. Finally, dinner came, and it was delicious. But I sat there afterward for 25 minutes with no one to refresh my water, take my accumulating plates or to give me my check! I My Uber arrived 15 minutes after I had finished my meal -- but NO CHECK. I was tempted to leave without paying but knew that was not right, so I took my credit card to the cashier and asked if I could pls pay before my Uber drover away. The server took my card, came out with a receipt, but not ONE WORD of apology. I felt angry and asked to see a manager...and then felt even angrier. I interrupted a conversation the owner was having at the bar, and apparently he was too enthralled to be concerned with the issues of an older woman at who had just spent $50 at his restaurant. When I mentioned to him what had happened, he said he already had spoken to the server. But again, not one apologetic word! As a business woman, I travel frequently, and it is not unusual at all for me to dine alone. In most cities and in most places, I am treated with courtesy because I am spending money at dining establishments. Vivace, however, acted like I was invisible. An older women dining alone -- who is she, anyway? The owner's attitude was even more disagreeable than the server's -- he could have at least apologized. Because he did not, I will not be back. I do not do business with people who do not treat people with courtesy -- especially when we are paying for it.  It is sexist and ageist to treat a paying female customer with such discourtesy. I felt like I was living in the 1800s. A simple ""I'm sorry"" was all it would have taken make the night right. That that did not happen signifies a disrespect and disdain for older women and demonstrates to me that this place is, sadly, a throwback to previous generations when such disrespect and hostility were mainstream.

We decided it would be a fun stop for a mid-week date night to try something new. We got bread for the table, bruschetta ($10) and the sausage & crispy polenta ($12) appetizers. The bruschetta comes with melted mozzarella, tomato, onions, and balsamic. The sausage and polenta comes with 2 full sausage links in a red sauce with peppers and onions on top of a square of polenta. The polenta was tasteless.

For entrees I got the orecchiette with sausage, broccoli rabe, tomato, and grana padano ($22). The sauce was so thin I couldn't pick any of it up with my fork (no spoon provided), and there was no grana padano cheese. It's more of a soup in this way. My partner got the carbonara ($19), which he said was very bland.

The best part of the meal was the warm bread and olive oil. It was truly a nice olive oil, and the bread was flaky and delicious with it. No complaints about service, but for the price of this Italian food, I would recommend you go to Tavola instead.",8.0,Vivace
2021-12-18,3.0,"Nice Staff and Decor, Mediocre Food and Long Wait

After several years of living in Charlottesville, I finally took a trip over to the famed Vivace. I had heard so much about this apparent staple of Charlottesville Italian food and I had put off trying this restaurant due to not having a ""valid enough"" reason for visiting the restaurant. My sister's graduation celebration demanded a visit, so I finally had an opportunity to visit it. 

Walking up to Vivace, it becomes apparent that the outdoor section of the restaurant is gorgeous; especially at night. The string lights and ambience alongside the UVA road is alluring, and had it not been the wintertime, I might have requested an outdoor table. They have heaters in appropriate places, so if you want to eat outside, it's still a realistic possibility. After being seated in an upstairs dining room that flooded my nostrils with nostalgia of my grandparents' attic, we were greeted by a nice waiter named Landry. This brings me to the best part of the meal: the service. Landry and the other servers were enthusiastic, knowledgeable about the food and drink options, and attentive almost to a fault! When you needed a drink refill, you got a drink refill. When you needed more fresh bread, you got fresh bread. 

Our appetizer was bruschetta. The dish was nicely complemented with fresh tomatoes and unrealistically delicious balsamic vinegar. A great start to a great evening. After our orders were placed, our experience soured. We waited for a minimum of 45 minutes for our food to be served. My friend pointed out that it had been at least an hour and that a party of 6 (2 less than our group) received their food and their bill even though they had arrived 15 minutes after us. Sure, the food had probably been made to order, but a 45-60 minute wait for food is an incredibly long amount of time. 

Eventually, the food came to the table. I received the Spaghetti and Meatballs; an Italian classic. The marinara sauce was uninspired. I tasted the food of my other family members. The food ranged from bland to pretty darn good. It's not bad, but there's certainly better Italian food in Charlottesville.

So would I revisit Vivace? If I had a friend ask me to join them in celebration at Vivace, the understandable prices, fantastic service, and decent decor wouldn't keep me from coming. But if you're looking for great Italian food, stick to Carmello's, Tavola, or Lampo.",188.0,Vivace

We were concerned about dining out during the most recent Covid spike, but the properly spaced tables and outside air coming in around the plastic sides put an end to our worry. It was a nice atmosphere.
  We started with the fried oyster appetizer which was on the specials menu. They were delicious! Very fresh with an excellent aoli alongside. Frankly the best we have had all year. The portion was very generous. 
  Next the wedge salad. Again delicious! The gorgonzola and pancetta were a perfect match.
  My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs which he said he enjoyed. I ordered the mussels with homemade tagliatelle pasta. Not something I normally order, but the fried oysters were so good I decided to keep with the seafood theme. The portion was huge with a generous amount of mussels. They were as fresh as the oysters. The tagliatelle was cooked perfectly. The sauce was just enough to allow the flavor of the mussels to shine. I brought most of my entree home, being full by then, and look forward to finishing it tonight!
   I really wanted to try the tiramisu but would have burst. Next time.

But recently I have visited twice as a patron. First time we ate out on the frigid, mostly empty, somewhat heated patio. Masks are not a strong preference of the staff, I gathered from my limited experience. We were outside, it was fine. We enjoyed the food, the service, the atmosphere. I loved the chicken picatta. I enjoyed it so much that a few weeks later, I ordered it again to go. 
The desserts are good, the pasta is good. I love the idea of visiting in the spring when the patio isnt so chilly.  I think this place has a lot of regulars who love it. And honestly, I get it, it's comfortable, friendly, tasty.",111.0,Vivace

2022-10-20,2.0,"Visited on a Tuesday with no reservations. We were a party of four and we were promptly seated. Our appetizers included the fried calamari and artichoke dip, which were good. For entrees we had penne with pesto and the special a New York Strip steak. The entrees we're fine though I was never asked how I wanted the steak cooked. It was prepared medium rare, but I prefer medium. No big deal, it tasted fine.
At the end of the meal I paid with credit card. The server brought the bill that had run with my credit card, but without my credit card. After over ten minutes of searching, they finally took my contact information. The server apologized. I guess things happen. I was not too upset. Later that evening I got a call, they found my credit card. Now the irksome part: to get back the card that they lost I had to come and get it. I live 23 miles from Vivace, and I need my card. Management made no offer or effort to return my card. The next day when I came back into town to pick up my card, they did not say, ""We are sorry for the inconvenience"" or anything similar. They asked me for my ID, and gave me back my card.
My gripe is the indifference that management showed me to my situation. Clearly, they have enough customers so they did not feel compelled to offer to help me or at minimum apologize for making me drive 56 miles roundtrip for their mistake. There are other restaurants in Charlottesville that are more customer-oriented that I will patronize in the future. Judging from Management's reaction so far, I am sure they could care less.",2.0,Vivace

We had reservations for prior to the Trans Siberian Orchestra. It wasn't packed but there was what seemed to be a family holiday dinner of about 7-10 people going on and it took about 15 mins for our server to come over and greet us/take our drink order. My mothers beer came moments before the meal however the server forgot martini and you could see it in her face. The bread came at same time as the meal which was unfortunate as we were starving after driving over an hour and every other table was receiving theirs in the beginning of the service. My pomegranate martini well after the meal did, but the food itself was delicious and very filing. The sauce had a nice taste and didn't overwhelm either plate. Fully aware of what a martini entails but mine definitely lacking in the actual chosen flavor and just tasted solely of the alcohol. Took a while to get our card back after paying the check, but it all could have been the young server having a bad day as other patrons seemed to be getting their food timely.

They bring out fresh bread that we dipped in some olive oil, S&P, and balsamic (you gotta ask for that). we got the calamari for appetizer and that just missed the mark for me. The squid was excellent (soft and not chewy at all), but the breading was cornmeal which gave it a gritty texture. Now for the entrees, they were HUGE. The pasta vivace was addicting.

We shared a really good salad and bread, then ordered our entrees. My entree was delivered with the wrong sauce which the server recognized right away. She took it back to the kitchen. I was then given the correct entree but it was not good. It was like a bowl of creamy pesto sauce with pasta hidden beneath. I didn't complain because it was edible, just not what I expected.

2024-06-26,2.0,"Yeah vivace has kinda fallen downhill since the last time I was in and I probably wouldn't be back at this point. All of my coworkers and friends agree. It was good a few years ago but is nowhere near what it used to be. TLDR: expect really basic kinda boring Italian food for twice as much as you should pay.

First thing is the ambiance in here is great - the building is really cool and the decor inside is great. They have started storing extra kitchen boxes in the foyer, which was a little weird, but overall the ambiance is nice. This is probably the best part of the experience here.

Service wise, not so great. Most of the staff I saw were either high schoolers or early college and act aloof like they're too good to talk to you or act bothered that they have to do their job. Their foyer is basically an intersection with a ton of other paths and the servers/staff will literally run into you while you're waiting at the host stand. Overall really rude. Staff was also walking around in pairs/groups chatting and it felt like I was eating in a cliquey high school cafeteria lol. Top it off with our rude server who joked that he had to check IDs because we ""look like a bunch of babies in a trench coat"" (were all in our mid-late twenties) and then continued to just make backhanded jokes to us the rest of the evening? Yeah. Not great.

Then there's the food. The arancini we got was actually pretty solid. The entrees were not. My ravioli was bland at best, pretty much plain cheese ravioli with vodka sauce. My boyfriends chicken picatta was so boring. Plain breaded chicken with plain spaghetti in what tasted like just straight lemon juice. Ugh

Everyone else at our table said the fettuccini Alfredo and the pasta primavera were similarly boring and bland. This place used to be good but is now a robbery. They are audacious charging as much as they do for some of the most boring Italian I've ever had.

Overall with the combination of our awful service and terrible food we would not be back. Would not recommend you give it a try. Cville is full of great restaurants and this is no longer one of them.",249.0,Vivace

2024-07-22,1.0,"I want to, first, make it very clear that our server, Linda, and every waiter/waitress we interacted with was fantastic. Almost every server that walked by took the time to stop and say hello to my well behaved golden retriever, Oatmeal. He was barking a tad at first, but a very nice blonde waitress came over and told us it was not an issue. Ever since the first time I visited, I loved Vivace (I even wrote a very positive review, see attached photos for proof); unfortunately, today I had a very negative experience and will no longer be a loyal customer nor will I ever recommend it as a place to visit again. We had a 6:30 reservation for two and a dog on the patio. We even noted in the reservation that our party included a dog. Oatmeal has sat on their patio multiple times without an issue, and tonight should have been no different. We ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees, yet after sitting on the patio for about two hours a new group of guests chose to sit on the patio. We were sitting right by the entrance to the patio and the front door, meaning that any guest requesting to sit on the patio very clearly knew there was a dog on the patio. Oatmeal was well behaved, and left all other guests completely alone, except for when they would come up and ask to pet him. The problem is, and the part that makes me feel incredibly disrespected, that management approached us halfway through our entrees and told us that they had recieved complaints about my dog. Now, if my dog had behaved in any way problematically I would have agreed and left without a problem. My dog did not go up to other tables, nor did he try and steal any food that was not our own. When I was obviously taken aback by this statement I asked the manager to expand on what exactly was done wrong, and I was informed that ""maybe his tail is hitting people's chairs"", yet the flaw in this was that the only table anywhere near us was completely empty. Very clearly, the newer table was more ""valuable"" than us because my dog was nowhere near them, and even though we were there first and had reserved a table for the dog they just wanted to appease them regardless of how it affected us which was not a fair solution to the problem. I am absolutely disgusted with the way management chose to prioritize them over us, and I am heart broken that I can no longer go to one of my favorite restraunts in Charlottesville because of they way they handled the situation. I proceeded to ask the manager if we were being kicked out, and after dancing around the question for a few seconds it was evident that he expected us to leave, again even though we had reserved the table with the stipulation of having a dog; furthermore, we kept the dog in control and well behaved the entire time. My dog did absolutely nothing wrong, and I am confident that the new table chose to sit on the patio with the intention of kicking the dog out for whatever reason, believing they are more important and more worthy than us. We sat on the patio for two hours, and did not get to actually enjoy our entrees. I think a very clear solution would have been to offer them an inside table if they did not want to be on the same patio as a dog. I am very disappointed that what was supposed to be a fun night at a nice restraunt ended with me leaving early and in tears. Again, Linda was lovely and took very good care of us. If the dog had truly been a valid problem, I have a hard time believing that we would have been able to sit on the patio for about two hours before anyone had to say anything about the dog's behavior to us.",1.0,Vivace

And who knows who is Italian or not half the people in Richmond Virginia that people think are black or actually Cherokee Indian but that's neither here nor there there's so many critics that shouldn't be critics because first you shouldn't be allowed to judge food with a condescending tone about any of the aspects of it unless you yourself can replicate it at at least the level that you are criticizing or better, it takes a lifetime just about to be able to do that and I'm not talking about eating at Olive Garden A lot of these things seem like personal stabs at the business for something that oh gosh, I could only imagine I've been a line Cook sous chef for the better part of my life and their food is top-notch.

The portions were awesome and I like to eat a lot, and from the looks of the parking lot when I pulled in full of nothing but Aldi's and Porsches and a lot of other high-end vehicles that were the guest patron the place I'd say that there were some pretty experienced pallets there and I almost felt out of place in my Audi A5 Quattro picking up some pasta dishes and some desserts, but I was greeted with kindness may have took a little bit longer than I expected, but that's my expectation not the flow of the business and of course the people were probably young adults because that is one of the better jobs for them to get to give them some real world experience interacting with the public on many different levels the only way for a server to do exactly what the patron would like is a for them to act like a complete and total asshole at the beginning of the dinner by giving the waiter or waitress ridiculous instructions to follow the entire time they're at the table they have to be able to read your mind so cut them some slackbecause if something happens somewhere, it's usually never the waiters or waitresses fault unless they forget something or they're very unattended and that is the learning experience of that job I mean for crying out loud they get paid 213 an hour which barely covers their taxes. I challenge anybody to take on a 12 burner sauté a broiler oven a four-door refrigerator reach under 16 item sauté station bottom themselves. oh with a broiler and two sets of small grill racks for, different fish and what not and you have no time left go so mad respect to those who do that job because I know what it's like while you have condescending pretentious, entitled individuals overlooking the experience and only attacking what they are seeking if you like Italian food, even Gordon Ramsay palette would it would keep his mouth shut. Please do not hesitate to go here and enjoy the atmosphere.

When better to stuff my face at places on my to go list than during Restaurant Week? C&O has been on my to go list of popular, high-rated dining experiences for a while now.

C&O is located at the end of the downtown mall a little past the Melting Pot in an antiquated building with what looks to be boarded up doors or windows or something in the front. When you enter, there is a small (by small I mean that it can fit 8-10 people) reception area with a fireplace. Beyond that, there is a dining space that looks like a long, narrow hallway. If you look closer though, you'll see that it is in fact a tiny room with a few tables cleverly reflected in a wall mirror. There is a bar off to another side room and an upstairs seating area as well.

While C&O definitely qualifies as fine dining, it aims to provide a comfortable atmosphere in it's traditional Virginia setting. Service was stellar and friendly (and thankful in one event) when I called several times on the phone as well as during our dinner.

To start, I had the arepa with braised pork, ricotta cheese, and pickled onions. This was an app that blew me away. The ricotta was housemade and not overpowering. The braised shredded pork was flavorful and tender. And I really liked the pickled red onions. Everything came together well on the arepa, a thick corn flour tortilla/bread, which may have been a little too thick as it tended to overpower some of the ingredients on top with its doughiness.

I had the bistro steak with sauce bordelaise. I do not think the cut of steak selected for the dish did it justice. Bistro steak tends to be soft on the outside but sinewy on the inside. However this cut of bistro steak may have been a little more sinewy than usual (only reason for 4.5 stars). Even with medium rare to avoid any toughness, I had a hard time cutting (much less chewing) this steak. As did others of my group. The outside had a nice smokey, seared flavor and went wonderfully with the red wine sauce and mashed potatoes (very flavorful with skin, the best kind of mashed potatoes) and some garlic sauteed asparagus (which were very fresh and young).

For dessert: the yummy Chocolate Pot de Creme. By this time, I was extremely full but I didn't want this excellent dessert to go to waste. It was not a rich chocolate and it had hints of cinnamon and/or nutmeg that made it unique and tasty.

Other notes: Crab and polenta looked tempting. Linguine with littleneck clams were housemade with beautiful coloring and thickness, served with whole large clam and not those dinky ones that come in canned soups. Creme brulee had beautiful looking and tasting caramelization, however the layer of custard itself was very thin. Cobblers came out piping hot and looked delicious.",497.0,C&O
2011-11-27,4.0,"This place came highly recommended - both from our hotel concierge, numerous pieces of printed material and many comments from people in the area. I can tell you, however, to ignore your first impression of the place - an old Pepsi sing hangs on the front of an older brick building, paint peeling from an old sign on the wall as well.

There was a film festival going on the weekend we were in town but we stopped in on a Friday to see if we could get a table somehow (everyone told us it would be impossible and they were right). The owner, David Simpson, was kind enough to give us a guided tour of the premises - up, down and outside. Everywhere we looked people seemed to be having a great time. We decided to try again before we left town.

Sunday night - we're in! David wasn't there but the hostess couldn't have been nicer and we were quickly seated in the downstairs dining room, which is also the bar.

Appetizers consisted of a House Salad for Carol and Local Chicken Soup with White Beans, topped with Chimichurri (fabulous). Entrees consisted of Blackened Alaska Salmon served with a sauteed potato/clam cake and buerre blanc. I had the Cuban Strip Steak with red onion Marmalade. Both entrees were excellent and the leftovers were nonexistent.

For our appetizers, we had the boston lettuce salad with pommery mustard dressing and the buffalo mozzarella which came with mushrooms and greens.  For our entrees, my partner ordered the steak chinoise (the forkful of steak and mashed potatoes dipped in the ginger sauce more or less melted in my mouth!) and I had the lamb and gnocchi (my mouth waters just remembering the complex flavor combinations of this dish).  I would not hesitate to order all of these again.  Of the drinks, my favorite was their hot toddy made with black tea, bourbon, and plenty of cloves!

C&O is a tiny three story restaurant located off the downtown mall.

The setting is perfect for a date night as the ambiance is quiet, cozy and dimly lit. Plus, they tried to leave a few empty tables around us and other couples for privacy. Side note: Definitely call in advance for reservations, as they get booked and we had to take an earlier dinner.

We again ordered Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer, and it was just as I remembered it from the year before: High-quality meat with fresh arugula, salty parm and a crunchy hashed potato.

For our entrees: I got Bass with crab, while Michal got the Ribeye Steak with mushrooms and potatoes. Both were hearty, generous, filling and flavorful dishes. The fish was incredibly fork tender, yet had a crisp sear on the outside - cooked to perfection. The steak was cooked as Michal asked, medium rare, with his fav veggie that reminds him of his childhood in the woods of his grandfather's farm. We happily traded plates mid-meal to complete our own ""Surf and Turf.""

Dessert - Enjoyed a divine Marscapone Cheesecake. It was tiny but rich. I appreciated how there was no crust and just ""filling."" The server put a little candle in the middle for me to blow out - nice touch!

However, as a former vegetarian for 2 years, the meat smelled and tasted too strong for me. The main dish featured chicken with asparagus. The chicken was wrapped in ham - not a good combination. Also the white sauce killed the freshness of the chicken. Finally the dessert. I got raspberry frisk. Too sweet and chuncky.

The dishes were prepared quite differently from each other and I thought they were good compliment with each other. The veal appetizer was amazing.  I wanted to lick the plate clean.

2017-07-29,3.0,"WARNING: If you get the pork tacos, they are EXTREMELY spicy.

Ok, now back to this regularly scheduled review. Let me give you some context to that first statement and start from the beginning. I was visiting in the Charlottesville. area and had been bar hoping all night in dire need of a meal (I had skipped dinner. When we finally got the opportunity to find a place to sit down for a meal at midnight, just about every place was closed. One of the servers at another restaurant recommended that the best place to go for late night for was C&O and she highly recommended the pork tacos. I mean HIGHLY recommended them. So what's a girl to do? Off we go to find C&O to get ourselves some pork tacos.

We finally find it down the strip and were seated at the bottom floor of the restaurant near the bar. Seems as if they were going to be closely soon, too, so we needed to get our orders in quickly. Two of us at the table went with the pork tacos (we do as were told), and someone else went with the cheeseburger. The late night bar menu is really limited, so there wasn't much else to select from that could opt as a meal.

The pork tacos finally arrive and in my hazy, tipsy state, I go head first! I take my first bite and get slammed with a mouthful of flavors. Overall, the taco was really delicious, but I couldn't grab my glass of water fast enough. These are some SERIOUSLY spicy tacos. I'm not one to shy away from spice, I like it somewhere in the middle between getting my tongue burnt off and feeling the tingle. I was truly shocked at how hot these tacos were and I had no warning signs to let me know. The woman who recommended the place/tacos didn't mention anything. The waiter who took my order didn't mention anything. Most of all, the menu didn't say a single mention that these tacos were spicy. Nothing. 

Overall, I was only able to get through 2 of the 3 tacos before my mouth had to call it quits. I wouldn't say I left hungry, but I definitely didn't leave satisfied. I mentioned before, the tacos actually had the potential to be really delicious if they weren't so overpowered by the unexpected spice factor.

The scallops were amazing and the sauce that it was served with was so flavorful.Then, we ordered the steak chinoise and chicken roulade for our entree. They were good, but they weren't very impressive in my opinion. To my surprise, the dessert was probably the star of the dinner. I fell in love with the strawberries and creams.

The food was well-presented, but I found some of the dishes too strong for me. I started off with the pear and pecorino ravioli, which was on the heavier side for a first course. The butter sauce was overwhelming, and overpowered the other flavors. I wasn't able to finish the dish because at one point, I felt like I was just consuming butter. I did try my friend's roasted sea scallops, which were flavorful and delicious. 

For the next course, I had the braised retreat farm lamb. The lamb did not have a gamey taste, but was a little salty. I'm glad it came with gnocchi to break up the taste, but still found myself reaching for the complimentary bread in between bites. 

Finally, I got the Meyer lemon creme brulee for dessert, which was definitely my favorite course. The creme brulee was smooth and fantastic! The huckleberry sauce adds a nice tart flavor.

The dessert was quite satisfying and a perfect way to conclude the meal.

I sat at the bar, where James took great care of me. He gave some great advice on the menu, and then also suggested that I should get some more of the house bread to scrounge up the sauce from the lamb dish.

The environment and ambience was very intimate and romantic, but that would not deter me from coming back here again (probably to sit at the bar) to enjoy the great food and service. This would definitely be a great place for a date though!",562.0,C&O

Generally good atmosphere. Music just the right level and genre. Not too loud. And we were a table of 6 and we could hear each other without having to yell. 

Right level of dim lighting but not too dark. 

Drawbacks: air conditioning was acting up. They turned it on and off throughout the night. When it was on it was too cold (can't they simply adjust it for a comfortable level?). When it was off it became muddy and too warm. 

Toilet was very dirty and shabby and old, not befitting such an upscale venue. Floor was all wet. Toilet paper, well let's just say I didn't dare use it. That says something about the conditions they are in. Luckily I have my own wipes.",894.0,C&O

There are always so many things I want to try and nothing ever disappoints.

2019-03-07,4.0,"If not for the parking (now a short walk to the garage and they validate) this would easily be a 5 star review. The ambiance screams historic building and when you enter you're greeted by a warm and cozy wood-burning stove. Our party of 6 was escorted to the downstairs dining area tucked near the bar. The walls are unique wood panels and some even have hinges that make it seem like hidden areas are behind them (prohibition era stuff maybe?)

The food was amazing, no one at my table was disappointed with their selections. But be ready to open your wallet. I'm very guilty of buyer's remorse especially in this situation of three dollar signs, I was so happy with my entree of Duck Breast. My expectations were high of course! Others ordered two appetizers and had it served as their meal so that's obviously an option as well. I did tell someone in my party that it was the most I have ever enjoyed duck. Great flavors as the sweet potato, smoked bacon and apple hash interplayed with the richness of the duck. I was excited to try the huckleberry gastrique since I've never had huckleberries before. It had a sweeter flavor and very enjoyable on my pallet. A very nice drink selection as well, plenty of craft beers and wines to chose from. 

I wish I had known about the parking garage validation because that would have lessened the sting of the walk (in winter weather) and fee.",161.0,C&O
2019-05-06,5.0,"My partner and I almost regretted stuffing ourselves with delicious cocktails at Alley Light because we couldn't eat as much as we wanted here at C&O. We ended up with just a few appetizers: seared scallops, bibb salad, beef carpaccio, duck confit. I've reviewed each dish from least favorite to most. (I'd recommend all the dishes though)

Duck confit: The ricotta gnocchi was delicious and plumply stuffed making it quite heavy. While the duck jus and duck confit were cooked to perfection, the duck jus definitely added to the heaviness of the dish, as expected. While we cleaned the plate, it was most difficult to scarf down. 

Bibb salad: My partner loved it. I thought it was small, even as an appetizer. Flavor was there but it was simply 7 leaves. 

Seared scallops: I put this 2nd best only because of the very minor nuances. The scallops are always tricky because if it's just slightly overcooked, the middle becomes chewy. These scallops were perfectly seared but slightly too salty. Combined with the cauliflower puree, the salt hid a bit but the cauliflower puree had some sour milk to it too so that was a little strange.

Beef carpaccio: Found no flaw in this. The greens that came with it were so deliciously dressed and came with very thin slices of raw beef. 

Service was excellent as was the ambiance. I'd love to come back some other time to try the main entrees.",420.0,C&O

   My family and I ate at the C&O after my son's graduation and we had a very nice and delicious meal, probably one of the best ones we've had in a long time. 
   After our meal, my daughter asked if we could ask for a flower from the table to leave at the Heather Heyer Memorial on the street on our way back to the parking lot. (I'm attaching a picture of the very small vase and flowers at our table.) I said I would ask.
   I approached a group of people by the bar and asked a server if we could take one flower and I explained why we were requesting it. She said she did not think there would be a problem, but she had to ask the manager, she then turned to a lady next to her and asked her, the lady then turned to me and after I explained again what I wanted she said that ""We still have two more services and if you'd like flowers, there is a very nice shop downtown at 4th street, etc., etc, and I'm sure they'd be happy to sell you all the flowers you'd like"".
   This response really turned me off after the nice meal we had just had. We had just paid for a $70.00dll/a person meal plus drinks and this lady manager had no qualms about sending us downtown for a flower. 
   Sometimes you have to use your judgement and think that a flower (Lily of the Incas, not expensive at all!!!) is not worth losing some potential clients, especially after these customers have just paid a good amount of money for your product.
   I wrote to the management, and the owner of the restaurant apologized and expressed his shock (his words) at the reaction to my request. He said in his email that he would take appropriate action and that's it. I have not heard from them and I don't know if I'll be back there. 
   Sad ending to a perfect meal.

2019-06-07,4.0,"C & O late night is my favorite meal in Cville!! I love the grilled cheese and tomato soup so much, but as Zhana mentioned it is a big portion and might be better for sharing depending on how hungry you are. Usually I love their burger as well, though sometimes it can be inconsistent-- I've had some that were pretty burnt. They recently changed to their summer burger (lettuce, tomato, jalapeño aioli) which I like less than the winter burger (I think it has cheese and onions/mushrooms) but it is nice that they keep it seasonal. 

I've had a few of their cocktails and while they are pretty good, you're just as well off ordering your favorite fancy cocktail (dirty gin martini on the rocks for me) because the bartenders are very competent. I like the ambiance in here-- dimly lit and sexy. Makes me feel classier than I am! 

The food at dinner is also great though definitely more expensive than late nite. The dining room upstairs is nicer than the main floor but I also like the terrace out back. In particular I recommend the steak chinoise which has been on their menu since they opened. The sauce it comes with is super unique and delicious as well! Definitely recommend closing out the meal with the chocolate bread pudding for dessert-- it's to die for! 

I'm knocking off a star not only because of the inconsistency of the burger but also because I've had a number of times at late nite when the staff is just rude. I get that it sucks to be working so late but I would expect more from such a classy establishment.",170.0,C&O

The late night burger has never let me down even though I think they recently changed it. The grilled cheese and tomato soup is very cravable. Another item that was awesome when they had it was the late night taco. I am mentioning this item because I hope management brings it back!!

Other than the great food at C&O you can get a pretty tasty cocktail. I appreciate a libation that makes you remember a place. The Alley Lite also does an excellent job at the food/cocktail combo but I digress. The atmosphere in C&O is different per floor and cozy in areas. An experience worthy of a visit.

The food at dinner is yummy but more expensive than late nite. The dining room upstairs is nicer than the main floor (girlfriend had to use the bathroom up there so we got to check it out).

For starters, we had tagliatelle, which was light with a great grated cheese on top, and scallops, which were cooked perfectly. Our mains were ribeye involtini (perfect cook, lots of flavor) and duck confit (great crispy skin, cleared the whole plate).

The only thing we were disappointed in was the dessert. The sticky pudding was crunchy on the outside like it was overcooked. I had a peaches and ice cream dessert and the peaches were not ripe at all. There was no flavor and they were so hard that it was difficult to eat. I would have rather them tell me that they took it off the menu if they didn't have ripe peaches.

The cocktails are expertly crafted, and the late night menu is small but mighty.

My husband's favorite is the grilled cheese with tomato soup - it's perfect for a chilly night! I most recently had the local Bibb lettuce salad. The mustardy vinaigrette is done just right and the gruyere is a nice complement to the lighter Bibb lettuce.

The food was amazing! We have lived in Northern California for about 8 years and have become spoiled by their food options. When visiting the east coast, we do not often find food up to that caliber, but C and O definitely did. We started with a light salad with a dressing that I would love to replicate. Next, along with the awesome shaved brussels, we had the trout and duck entrees; both were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. To finish, I got a cheese plate and my husband got a chocolate treat.

Restaurant is small, and seating is limited - but they fully utilize all three levels of the small historic building they are located in.  It is January - and cold.  I do think the restaurant was not super well insulated - so if you run cold, bring an extra sweater.

Service is exceptional.  From coat check, to check in, to meal - everything was top notch.  Parking is validated in the Market St and Water St garages - bringing the parking fee down to $1! Such a wonderful convenience.

Now the food is excellent.  To start, I had the beef carpaccio - which I would reorder in an instant.  Thin sliced beef with a nice creamy sauce thin layer and dressed with a lovely arugula and parmesan cloud of delight.  My main was the duck confit- and it was savory and delicious.  It is hearty but not super gamey.  My dinner partner got the lamb cassoulet and it was an equally hearty more ragout style.  Dessert was a little disappointing for me - I got the sticky toffee pudding and found it underwhleming.  The cake was a burnt on the bottom, and the toffee sauce was excessively sweet.  Creme Fraiche though was on point.  the cheese dish was so tasty - I might consider making that my dessert next time.  A great combo of creamy and stinky - the cheese selection was absolute fire.

The atmosphere here feels more upscale, with a nice warm fire greeting you during colder months. There's seating for dinner both upstairs and downstairs. It's small place so I'd recommend asking for upstairs seating if possible--you get more room.

The waiters here are great--have never had an issue with an inattentive waiter or  long waits for apps or between apps and main courses and I've come with party sizes between 4 and 8.

Entrees: had to get the duck confit and the farm lamb cassoulet. Overall, I will say that these were similar dishes - savory, filling, and strong on the flavors. Nothing was mild or subtle!

2020-05-06,5.0,"Note: I'm writing this review during the statewide sars-cov-2 closures.

C&O is my favorite restaurant in Charlottesville, has been for many years. Later, I can write lovingly about the ambience and service, etc. For now, I want to focus on the pandemic takeout experience. In short, it's perfect.

They offer a changing takeout menu each week, with some a la carte options. You can order online, then pick up the next evening. You just pull up in front and they'll ask your name, and bring your order out. You don't even have to get out of the car, thus very limited exposure. And you can tell they're taking it seriously: gloves, mask, hand sanitizer, etc. It's all smooth and professional.

We've been ordering once a week or so, and I've been amazed at how well the food travels. Even my favorite delicate dish, the pan fried trout (amandine), reheats beautifully in a warm oven. Ricotta gnocchi with duck confit, striped bass, sticky toffee pudding, etc. - most of my favorite dishes rotate in eventually and have been excellent. 

The price is fairly high, for our food budget at least, but given the quality of the food and generous portions of the sides, salad, and dessert that come with each meal - I think it's a great value. We are certainly delighted with it and plan to keep ordering regularly.",11.0,C&O

For my appetizer, I got the Hamachi Crudo. It was very fresh and plentiful. There was a sweet sauce on top that cut into the fattiness. My SO got the russet potato gnocchi with king crab. It was a $12 upcharge. I wish it was a little bigger portion or had more crab, but besides the size it was fantastic taste. There was an incredible sauce that really brought it all together. For the entrees, I got the duck breast and he got the steak chinoise. Both were delicious and plenty big enough, but WOW his steak was out of this world. I was nervous the tamari ginger sauce on it would be overpowering but it melded perfectly with the steak. The potatoes (on both dishes) were buttery in texture and delicious in taste. Lastly, for dessert we got the chocolate pavé and coconut gateau. As I'm not a big  sweet person (and at that point already very full), I didn't rage over either but nonetheless had no complaints.

Some of them said they weren't ""creative"" or stellar but nobody outwardly said it was bad. I just wanted to give my honest experience for those whose entire days can be ruined by a bad meal.

My family is visiting from Florida and I wrote up a full Charlottesville itinerary. It was their first trip here so I wanted it to be special. I was between Fleurie and C&O for tonight and WISH I picked Fleurie. The menu seemed strong, but boy was the food not good (at least for me).

I started with a glass of wine and the new pasta special. I LOVE pasta, especially house made. It was honestly awful. It just didn't taste right. When the best feature of a dish is... English peas, something isn't right. It had an awful sauce and didn't TASTE like the description. My brother had the beef carpaccio and raved about it and my mom had the scallops and they were excellent. I'm glad they were happy but it was honestly one of the worst dishes I've ever had. I had high hopes for my entree since the waitress (who was honestly amazing otherwise) recommended it. I had the lamb and my brother and mom had the halibut. The lamb was criminally bad. It had... another gross sauce on it. It was almost drowned in this sauce. It was served over a bland polenta. I haven't had many lamb dishes I didn't like, but this one was hard to eat. This time, my family said the halibut was severely overcooked but the sauce was delicious. For dessert I had the creme brûlée and it was good. My brothers cheese plate looked like airline food.

Overall... beauty atmosphere, stellar service, but I spent over $100 for awful food. Very upsetting. Maybe I ordered wrong or something but I don't care to go back and find out. For the love of god CHILL on the sauces on literally everything.",397.0,C&O

The restaurant is eclectic with a dark and moody bistro downstairs and an airy, more homey upstairs. I expected people to be dressed a little more tastefully but most guys weren't even wearing collared shirts, it seemed. 

We went all out and got cocktails, apps, entrees and desserts each and it goes without saying -- everything, everything, everything was delectable. My wife ate the seared tuna and she will never touch raw(ish) fish like that, and here she is trying to take more pieces. I got the steak chinoise and naturally it was incredible with the ginger-tamari bearnaise. I love high dollar steak but compared to the simplicity of a nice filet, it is elevated when you have a steak that you can just mop up plate sauce with. 

My wife ordered the duck confit app as an entree which is fitting it comes out looking like an entree. That's the one weird thing that stuck out with us - why is this on the app menu? How is this supposed to be shareable? Regardless the ducks fall apart and the ricotta gnocchi are perfect. 

The cocktails were great. The dessert was great. The server was great. The experience was great. 10/10 will be making a return trip every time.",19.0,C&O

We had a reservation for my birthday.  We were seated with a great ordeal, in an empty restaurant right on top of other people enjoying their dinner.  We were so close that we could have ate their dinner. 

It took forever to get served and it seemed like the server had better things to do than serve us. 

The food was okay, portions were small and very underwhelming 

We actually left still hungry and had to stop at the grocery store",19.0,C&O

It was my boyfriends birthday and they were able to stick a candle in the dessert he picked as a little surprise. Absolutely would go again! 2 glasses of wine, 2 appetisers (very generous portions- not complaining), 2 entrees and one dessert was about $220. Just putting pricing there for guidance.

2021-12-17,5.0,"We were wonderfully surprised to find this hidden gem. We've lived in the area for over 10 years. We'd look for a novel special occasion restaurant several times a year, never discovering C&O, until this week on our 42nd wedding anniversary.
We were seated at an intimate location. The interior is warm, quiet & inviting, however the exterior is quite deceptive.
The service was spectacular. We felt as if we had a dedicated server. He was very attentive, at the same time unobtrusive.
While the menu is relatively limited, I still wanted to try everything! We had a difficult time deciding.
Now to the food! WOW!  I really don't know what they could possibly need to receive a Michelin award. Flavors perfectly blended, cooked to perfection with beautiful presentation. Hubs had salmon, I had tuna....OH MY GOSH!!
We started with the scallop appetizer and finished with the crème brûlée. Everything was just perfect.  Will definitely return.

2021-12-20,5.0,"Was floored the entire experience at C&O. So elegant and intimate with only about 5 tables total. The staff made us feel like we were special and was very informative in helping us decide. The duck confit gnocchi was a star. The bouillabaisse special had massive chunks of lobster. We were told the steak Chinoise is what they're most known for, but I wasn't overly impressed with it.  But overall it was a really nice fine dining experience",121.0,C&O
2021-12-22,3.0,"Let's me start this by saying We love C&O.  The ""we"" is my wife and I.   We live Downtown and have a wide selection of restaurants from which to choose and definitely have our favorites.  C&O always makes that list even though we frequent it less often than many others.  It's pricier for one and harder to get a table for another.  So, all of that said, we hadn't been in since Covid started and were excited to go back last week.  The charm is still there.  The downstairs bar is our favorite, feels like a different world in a good way.  And the wait staff is lovely and attentive.   My main issue - and the reason for the 3-star review - is that the food has slipped significantly while the prices have risen dramatically.  Menu has changed - plenty of favorites now gone.   My Rockfish was OK - but swimming in Sweet Potato (roasted fall squash according to the menu) to the point that the flavor of the dish was basically sweet potato pie.  I scraped 2/3's of it off and it still was overwhelmed with 'squash'.    $42 for a small piece of rockfish and a can of sweet potato.  The prices here are competing with NYC prices. But the food isn't keeping up.  I worry that regulars are going to get priced out.  I understand Covid has changed the game for restaurants - it's incredibly hard to hire good staff, food prices and inflation are going in the wrong direction, the lingering fear of the pandemic has decimated traffic.  How to survive?  I don't have the answer.  But when we think of going out for dinner next time, C&O will be off the short list b/c I just don't feel like paying $40+ for mediocre piece of fish or $50 for a decent but unexceptional piece of steak.  Breaks my heart to write this but I feel like it's a matter of time before the equation for what makes C&O such an incredible place gets decimated.  I hope I'm wrong.",82.0,C&O

The cocktails were really sweet and not unique. Like, if you're only doing the classics, then make them perfect. The arugula salad with warm goat cheese was good--but it's also hard to mess up heating up cheese. The roasted scallops were pretty good too, and I was happy with them, but not the best I've ever had. The duck confit gnocchi was where we were REALLY disappointed.

My criticism are small, just like their portions, but definitely expect to pay $$$$ for appetizers, dinner, and drinks. Their entrées start at $37. The scallops are $24 and there are 4, maybe 5 total so I do NOT recommend that dish. But their beef tartare is some of the best in town. Drinks on the menu or off, their bartender will make it delicious! It is a little off the mall so you can park a bit down the street and walk. Pre-pandemic they had late night C&O which was a great post date or night out nightcap. The prices were much more affordable but the standards and taste was just as good. I hope they bring that back.

Potatoes au gratin were good, but fairly plain (hard to care when the steak they came with stole the show).  Ended the meal with a delicious crème brûlée.

Came here for Dinner Friday May 20

Service was poor. Note this was no surprise as you've known for a year this would be a busy nights

Bar - bartender was very very very slow 

Fresh bread was stale (warmed up) and so hard I almost cracked a tooth. 

 ++ Appetizer- salmon, pasta and carpaccio were excellent 

++ Main - duck (fair) , tenderloin and lamb very good with tender and deep flavors

- - - Potatoes and asparagus were cold, ice cold!!

+ Dessert was good, toffee pudding was extraordinary, creme brûlée was pre made, dark chocolate bread pudding was okay

- - - - Service was disappointing (server she took our order and never came back) some other guy serving water who we'd not seen at all came up 75% through our meal and asked how our meal was...kinda a fly by.

- I ordered a second round of drinks that took 14 minutes (meal was over) server never came back!!

For a big celebration we had a good time but not without distractions you created that could easily have been avoided!

Update: The owner called,  sincerely apologized and did the right thing.

The highlight of the night for me was the crab cake. This was hands down the best crab cake I have ever tried. So much flavor and they did not skimp on the crab meat. I love the sauce and tomato garnish. The sticky toffee cake was my second favorite dish. The flavor was cinnamony, rich and indulgent. The salmon was pretty good but nothing too memorable.

We started off with some bread and butter which was pretty good. We ordered 2 appetizers to share which were the butternut squat ravioli and the braised retreat farm lamb. Everything came out great and the lamb was a treat to eat. The butternut squash was amazing too. We got cocktails as well and I did not like mine but the server had no problem with exchanging it for something I enjoyed. The only reason why I left a star out was because we were waiting for our server to come back and offer us dessert but we had to ask someone else. It took awhile for him to come back to us.

Our server was absolutely amazing!!!! he gave many great recommendations and the first being the scallops. The scallops were cooked perfectly, not fishy, the cauliflower sauce and raisin were the perfect touch. I could have eaten like 5 more plates of those. Second I ordered the New York strip steak and it was cooked medium rare which is perfect. Part of the meat almost dissolves in your mouth and other parts were a little more chewier. I'd def order again. My bf got the roasted halibut which he loved. I ordered the coconut cake for dessert and it was perfect. It was extremely moist and just dissolves in your mouth. 10/10 recommend this place. The service was on point. Our waiter was so sweet, very knowledgeable I wish I knew his name.

2023-05-15,4.0,"Dined in for an early meal Saturday night, first time here. There wasn't any street parking nearby so parked in a paid lot a few blocks away. We were seated upstairs which I would call a ""grandmas house"" vibe. Cream colored walls with landscape paintings, white tablecloths and wooden chairs with woven straw seats. I was in the corner beside a large glass window that was parallel to someone's apartment who also had a large glass window. We were maybe 40' from each other? A straight line of sight between the person on his couch and me at the dinner table. Somewhat uncomfortable but not a deal breaker. The menu had a variety of offerings and we settled on the tuna crudo app, halibut for me and salmon for my partner. The tuna was delicious, great use of herbs/olive oil to flavor. The halibut was just ok. It was drenched in a lemon butter sauce, like when you hit the bottom of a ketchup bottle and it empties onto your plate. I scraped off what I could to get a taste of the fish, which was good. There was also what the waiter called a relish on the plate as well but it tasted like a chunky spaghetti sauce. The flavor didn't pair well with the lemon butter, seemed like two opposing tastes. My guy enjoyed his salmon. It was supposed to be potato crusted but only 1/3 of the top of the fish was covered. We skipped dessert as we were pressed for time to get somewhere else. The service was great and made up for the disappointment of my meal. Now that I've dined I would definitely go again but next time ask for any sauces on the side if possible and to sit downstairs where it's a low-lit sexier vibe where you don't run the risk of eating across from someone on their couch.

The server was really nice too. He let me sample one of the beers before I purchased it and checked in on me throughout my time there.

And it can get noisy. Had a table on the upper level. Tables are spaced adequately but the open ceiling creates a sometimes noisy environment. Appetizer of Shishito Peppers which was good but could have been better without what I believe was garlic aioli. Companion had Salmon and rated it as outstanding. Nice, slightly crispy outside while translucent in the interior. Not over cooked. I had the Steak Chinois. Wasn't blown away. Cut of beef was good and although sliced at presentation, was a bit tough. Still it was cooked as I requested. I felt the sauce atop took away from the meat's taste and it somewhat ""buried"" the steak.  Desert of Sticky Toffee Pudding was served warm.  It was good but not something I'd order again.  The menu at C&O is, as noted, somewhat small but to be expected given the quality of the food and presentation.  Prices are no worse than any other fine dining restaurant.  Would I return?

2024-02-17,3.0,"The ambiance was sublime, the wine perfect. The service was attentive and pleasant throughout. This restaurant is a local favorite and for good reason. Here's the thing: You need to like creamy dishes. Sorry, I mean you need to LOVE creamy dishes. The Steak Chinois is soaking in sauce. The duck breast special was delightful, but glazed to within an inch of its, er, life. We like to see the protein shine through on its own, but here every beef, duck, and (I'm assuming from the menu description) lamb is drenched in a tasty if over-applied sauce. This reminds me of Julia Child's American invasion. Of what we thought French food was 30 years ago. Even the Brussel Sprouts did laps through an aioli sauce. Everything seems to ride atop a bed of puree - be it potato or cauliflower or whatever. The meat was cooked perfectly, the dishes were tasty. But the overwhelming presence of a cream note to nearly everything on the menu (from reading, we only tried two)? 

Again, if you like saucy dishes, this is your Eden. 

We would love to come back when the sauce to protein/vegetable is more balanced. We are new to the area, and this approach seems to be working for this gem of a location - but goodness this was rich.

2024-05-03,4.0,"I found this interesting-looking restaurant online and booked it for my birthday dinner with my mom and her fiancee while we were in town.

We arrived at 8:30pm for their last seating (only reservation I could get) and were seated downstairs by the door next to a table of three men drinking wine and being loud.  The manager came over and asked if I'd like to move upstairs bc she knew I'd requested a quiet table.  That was great.  I appreciated that.

So we moved upstairs to a much quieter table by the window.

It went downhill after that.  Our server was french or something and he was rude.  It took a LONG time for him to come take our drink orders and when he asked if we wanted wine I said no and my mom ordered a tea.  He then asked if we were all OK with water and I said, let me see the drink menu, while I was looking, he simply walked away.  He didn't ask my husband or my mom's fiancee what they wanted.  We were like, what? 

My husband went to hunt him down and he came back and I said, just because we hadn't ordered wine didn't mean we didn't want something else to drink.  I ordered a tea and they ordered a beer and bourbon.  

After about 10 minutes I asked him where my tea was and he said ""Maybe I would get it"".  I was pissed, he was rude about it and you could tell he was trying to be a smart ass.  I realize bar drinks take a minute - but this was sweet tea and he was clearly catering to all his other tables and ignoring ours. 

I was pissed and planned to tell him off about how rude he had been from the start and exactly what we had done to offend him when I was trying to have a nice birthday dinner with my mom who I never see.  It's pricey to eat here - with entrees around $35-50 each and I don't want to be talked down to  or treated badly by servers when I've been nothing but polite.  I used to wait tables so I am a generous tipper and try to be mindful of asking for too much or try to give advance notice. 

The food was actually very good.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I had the potato encrusted salmon, my mom ordered the halibut, and my husband had their signature steak steak dish and I thought it was the best dish of the night.

They have a nice dessert menu and I saw several things I wanted to try but I went with the sticky toffee pudding in the end and it was very good.  They put a little candle on it for my birthday.

The saving grace was the same manager who helped me in the beginning, she brought us bread when I spoke to her and asked if they were out and had the kitchen heat up a little something else.  Our server didn't even try.

We started with the bread and butter. The bread dense, warm, with a slight sweetness. I tried the arugula salad with fig, candied pecans, and burrata. It was delicious and portioned well. For my entree, I got the duck confit and ricotta gnocchi. I was hesitant to get this since I don't typically order duck, but the waitress promised it was delicious. Sure enough, this was a memorable dish! The duck was so tender and roasted in a sauce that was flavorful and not overly salty. The ricotta gnocchi was a great accompaniment to the dish. My only wish is that there was more- I think there were only 4 or 5 total. My husband tried the crab cake and bolognese. I'm glad he got two dishes because one certainly wouldn't have filled him up. The crab cake was not skimpy on the crab and was paired with a nice sauce. The bolognese pasta was also pretty tasty. We ended the meal with creme brûlée. While it was pretty good, I've had better.

Visit: October 2023

Shenandoah National Park in Virginia is one of the top spots in the United States to enjoy fall foliage, and my wife Jun and I had visited the park on a road trip every fall since we moved to the DC area. While we stayed at different places around the park, we had not visited Charlottesville where the University of Virginia is located until this year. When we finalized our plan to stay overnight in Charlottesville in late October last year after driving through the stunning Skyline Drive, I was looking for a restaurant to grab dinner. C&O, which had long been one of the most beloved institutions in the town, appeared in all of the several ""where to dine in Charlottesville"" lists I had found online. After our dinner at the restaurant, we both agreed that C&O is a solid choice for those visiting Charlottesville.  

The menu at C&O features classic dishes with French countryside influence. There won't likely to be a dish you hadn't seen before, but that doesn't mean the execution from the kitchen was overall good. We started with skillfully pan roasted scallops with whipped cauliflower, and shared a couple of main dishes in duck confit on top of ricotta gnocchi and grilled lamb chops. Jun, who has high standard when it comes to duck dishes, praised the duck confit as above average, and I thought the lamb chops (which came with mint salsa verde and potato puree) were grilled quite nicely. If you have room for dessert after savory dishes, I highly recommend trying a few at C&O. We both savored the vanilla crème brulee with enthusiasm, and the wild huckleberry sundae with caramelized pistachios was also wonderfully delightful.   

When we entered the restaurant, Jun and I were surprised to find white tablecloth on dining tables; we just hadn't expected a more formal dining experience, especially given the somewhat modest look of the exterior. If you are looking for a romantic dinner, I recommend asking the staff to be seated at the back of the dining room with candlelit tables. The wine list was another pleasant surprise at C&O where you will find an expansive group of bottles at varying prices from different parts of the world. If you are driving to the restaurant, you can park your car at a public parking garage nearby (the restaurant offers parking validation). While we have yet to fully understand or embrace what life in the Virginia countryside is like, I feel C&O quite adequately captures the culture and ethos of the region with soulful dishes that may not dazzle you like a Michelin star fine dining restaurant does but will nevertheless make you smile with satisfaction.",721.0,C&O

They're open late - the place is always jumping (*note: they don't accept reservations and at peak hours expect to wait up to an hour), and the food was amazing. It seems as though the quality has declined over the last few years. 

*The patatas bravas are still good, the tortilla española has been too oily, cheese plates have been significantly downsized (but still tasty), and the seafood from time to time is over-sauced. 

If you aren't a tapas fanatic, you may still enjoy the restaurant because, even with the few 'not so perfect', most of the dishes are prepared and served wonderfully.

The seating is a bit limited but they also have patio seating But it was cold so we chose to sit inside. We ordered  a few tapas and 1 large pitcher of Sangria (they only have red) which has about 6-8 cups. It is a bit stronger then sangria that i've had but it's really good. The tapas  we tried were:

Datil con tocino -fat, juicy, pitted Medjool dates roasted inside of applewood-smoked bacon-really good mix of sweet and salty

Jamon y queso -18 mos. aged Jamon Serrano and Manchego Cheese- good but it needed a crunchy element

Empanada-roasted local , organic pumpkin from Radical Roots,chevre,sage in a flaky pastry w/ crema, honey- the chevre overpowered the pumpkin a bit

Judion-local,pastured  Mangalisa pork belly w/ buttery white beans from Leon,local organic chard,mirepox,tomatoes and herbes  -pork belly was melt in your mouth and the white beans were firm but had a soft center. I think I  could have eaten a whole bowl of them.

Pato confitado-raditional Catalan dish of buttery duck confit w/ fresh figs, concord grapes., garlic,Amontillo, sweet butter

-figs were so fresh tasting 

wAtun-#1 Grade Yellowfin tuna grilled very rare only served w/smoked tomato alioli,grey sea salt- smoked tomato alioli was amazingly good.Tuna was a bit too over done but I'm used to eating raw tuna.

Chorizo -eponymous pork,garlic and pimenton sausage lightly grilled w/hearth-baked bread-chorizo had a nice snap to it.

Tortilla Espanola
the classic  Spainish tapa of yukon gold potatoes,sweet onions,local farm eggs,extra virgin olive oil, gray sea salt.- Dish was good but the potatos and onions lacked a bit of flavor the gray sea salt on top helped but w/o the salt the dish was a bit plain.


Our fave tapas were the Dates wrapped in bacon, the wAtun  yellowfin tuna w/ the smoked tomato alioli and the Judion mangalisa pork belly with buttery white beans.

All the dishes were really good and you could taste the freshness in the local ingredients.  Although the tapas are a bit pricey you have to remember that  your paying for quality of the food and experience .I am  for sure coming back the next time I'm in Charlottesville to see what other dishes they offer.",482.0,Mas Tapas
2012-11-17,4.0,"First things first: I don't like tapas. Call me crazy but small portions (or the shudder-inducing ""nibbles"" or ""small plates""), jacked-up prices, and a whole dinner built around communal sharing with an overriding aftertaste of hunger are not my idea of a good time. I'm quite surprised that the whole restaurant scene built around tapas has lasted as long as it has, because my philosophy is, I've found this awesome dish. I've ordered it. And now that I know how good it is, the sight of your fork coming closer and closer to the food in front of me is enough to bring a rush of red to my head. 

Anyway, I'm giving Mas a pass on my general resentment of Tapas, because I had heard for quite some time about how good the food was and I can fully back that up. Mas also features tons of locally sourced ingredients, from AMFog mushrooms to beef from Free Union Grass Farm and Silky Cow, which is nice in that you can taste how fresh everything is but bad in that if you don't get here early enough, the kitchen runs out of the more popular dishes, like the bacon-wrapped dates. The menu also has quite the complicated symbol and key system, with things like FUN, WILD-CAUGHT, and BALANCED PAIRING. 

My table first ordered a small pitcher of sangria to share, and it was the perfect acidic balance of fruit and wine. I will say that I could have easily gone without my one glass of sangria if it meant that the $20 could have gone towards two extra dishes, but the birthday girl requested some booze. But you want to hear about the food! These were the dishes that came recommended by both Yelpers, friends, and waitress. 

Datil con Tocino: aforementioned bacon-wrapped dates. Comes 4 in one bowl. It's kind of impossible how something so simple can taste so delicious, but this was one of the dishes that I wish we could order extra of. 

Ensalada de espinaca: baby spinach with pine nuts, raisins, and mango vinaigrette. Palette-cleanser and provided some greens. 

Papas con crema: like a potato lasagna stuffed with Manchego cheese. Wait a bit for the cheese to crystallize on the bottom and you get nice crispy dark brown bits. 

Roasted artichoke hearts and goat cheese: wished for more hearth-baked bread. 

Chorizo: pork + garlic + pimenton sausage. I'd be okay with eating this, cheese, bread, and wine for the rest of my life. My stomach probably wouldn't. 

Empanada: pastry turnover stuffed with pumpkin, ginger, sage, with some cheese-like creme on the side. More savory than sweet. 

Fat Gulf shrimp grilled in their shells: my eyes popped out of my head as soon as I spotted a waiter carrying these babies to a nearby table. So succulent. It was like everything else in the world had disappeared and all that remained was the shrimp and I. 

Albondigas: beef and pork meatballs. Wanted more shrimp. 

We also ordered the hugely disappointing goat cheese cheesecake: the goat cheese managed to overpower any hints of sweetness or sugar. The little dollops of raspberry syrup on the side did not help. 

Tip: come as early as possible. My group of 7 came here at around 5:30 on a Friday and snagged the last big table in the back. Fifteen minutes in, a line had already started forming for tables, though there were still a few empty seats in front of the bar.

Would like to come back soon to have a Racion of that shrimp all for myself.",1423.0,Mas Tapas
2012-11-29,3.0,"The menu changes often so I suggest talking with your waiter and ask for descriptions and suggestions. I love the open kitchen and watching the chef prepare all the dishes. The food comes out quickly so props to the chefs but the service can be extremely slow because it can really crowded. From my experiences, your waiter can really great or really bad. They really need to make their service more consistent. 

Many of the items are just wonderful on the menu and I really like how they stay conscious on using seasonal and local items. My favorites include the yukon gold potatoes with aloi, bacon wrapped dates, artichoke goat cheese dip, shrimp with aoli and sea salt, beef tartar, and raw tuna salad. The plates can range from $4-$20 for the ""tapas"" or regular size and they offer the double sized portion for each dish. I suggest staying towards the lower end because I feel like the more expensive items are not worth it and are not as easy to share. 

Some items may also be a miss so be careful--again, I recommend talking to your waiter and telling them your preferences! For example, I tried their chirizo once and they were like a charred bricks. The Serrano ham dish with the manchego cheese is also not worth it because it's just really thin slices of cured meat with even thinner slices of cheese. Their hummus was also not very special. 

Tip: They do not take reservations so it's best to go during off times or weekdays. The wait can be 1-2 hours .

Tip: Instead of ordering the bread alone which is already $4, order the cheese dips because they include their house bread for just a few bucks more.

It was a tricky finding the entrance on the patio but it was urban chic inside. The downstairs was super breezy near the door, so bring a coat! The setting was dark and modern. The bathrooms discretely overlooked the seating area, covered in wooden paneling. 
Food wise was a gastronome's delight! Of course the obligatory spanish olives, plethora of distinct cheeses and a larger selection of either wine or beer. Though I didn't find the papas bravas (roasted potatoes  w/alioli) that impressive, the jamon, empanadas and ensaladas were que delicioso!

Friendly waitress, intimate/classy yet fun setting (including a huge patio), fantastic food, killer sangrias, awesome company ... what else could you really want in a night? (Although I can't guarantee you the great company when you visit. Thankfully I came with great friends).

The restaurant uses ingredients from about a dozen or more local companies, which is an added bonus. Lots of organic and fresh vegetables and free-range chicken. Just looking at the menu and the vast array of choices can be overwhelming, but I feel like a lot of thought has put into not only the types of ingredients used but the way they're cooked/paired together to prepare each dish.

We ordered plenty of food for the three of us to share and feast on, but the one I keep remembering is the bacon-wrapped dates. I didn't even know I liked dates! Fat, juicy and pitted, roasted inside of applewood-smoked bacon. 

Another great dish: the smoked tomatoes that were resting in their own tomatoey juices.

We ordered two orders of Carne Asada for our table and were a little surprised at how rare it was served. Believe me, I like my steak rare for the most part, but this was really, really rare.  Actually, it looked dangerously rare in my opinion. 

When our waitress came by we asked if we could please get the meat cooked a little more as we were concerned about how raw it looked. Much to our surprise we were told the chef will not cook it anymore because it is suppose to be served very rare.  Hunh?  Is the chef eating with us?!?  Is the chef paying for it?!?  I've never heard this before.

Service was a bit horrible and our waitress disappeared throughout the night.  

The olives at the beginning were delicious. 

There are vegetarian options on the menu, but nothing really stood out.  

Moutabel - the description sounded better than it tasted!!  The beets just tasted like beet mush served with bread.  We couldn't taste the tahini or red peppers.  After a few bites the beets just become overwhelming.  

Queso cocido con alcachofa - goat cheese and artichokes.  This was ok, but the goat cheese was very heavy.  

Roasted veggies with bread - the bread was the best part (buttery and crunchy). The veggies were ok, nothing special and a bit bland.

Halibut - I liked this dish a lot and thought the fish was cooked very well.

2014-05-20,5.0,"I try to be a mindful reviewer when I yelp, and do check out a review or two of popular places before posting my own. That being said, I do acknowledge that one poster said for those who are foodies and have eaten elsewhere, this place is not that great. I would have to respectfully disagree - I have eaten in quite a few different U.S. cities (LA, Chicago, NYC, DC, Philly, etc.), as well as abroad, and still really enjoy Mas! 

I will say that the wait is pretty bad, but if you manage to entertain yourself for the +1 hour wait - I would say it's worth it. Why? Well, each dish is it's own little theatrical show. I felt the flavors were purposely chosen and paired and the items were prepared carefully and well. My personal favorite would be the lamb shank,  bacon wrapped dates (I know, I know, everyone said it already but it's for a reason!), as well as the papas bravas (not the sexiest dish, but I love the herbs used on the potatoes and the serving size is gracious).

Bottom line - this place has a nice exposed brick and wood charm that is akin to a lot of local owned places in NY and the atmosphere, although dim, feels upbeat and social. The last time I was here was with a group of 5. It was the ideal size for sharing dishes and still getting enough that we each felt full. I thought our service was decent, but can completely understand the complaints. :/

2014-08-11,5.0,"We were looking for a place for dinner after wine tasting in the area on Saturday and the owner of the B&B we stayed at recommended Mas Tapas, so off we went. 

I have to be honest here, you can never tell with tapas, so I was slightly unsure of how much to order, but picking 2-3 things each for our table of 4 left us all content and didn't break the bank. 

We started (and ended) our meal with the bacon wrapped dates (yep, they were so good we ordered them twice), a pitcher of sangria and a potato dish, while we waited at the bar for a table to open up.  

It took about an hour for our name to be called; the hostest wasn't comfortable quoting us a time when she put us on this list, since she said with tapas if people don't show up at the same time (I guess they were spread out this particular evening) it's hard to gauge how long they will stay.   I really appreciated her being so up-front about this. 

It was actually pretty cool watching the restaurant work so well together as a team! They were slammed, but you would never know it by the level of service we received.

Once we were seated we transferred our tab to our table (I double checked this didn't short the bartender and was assured it wouldn't) and ordered several more small plates to share. I LOVED the shrimp, the hummus, Plato de Jamon and the heirloom tomatoes.  

We split the goat cheese cheesecake (I was intrigued) and even though I wasn't a huge fan of it, my dinner companions had no problem making it disappear very quickly.

2015-09-18,4.0,"I've been waiting to go to Mas Tapas ever since I heard my girlfriend and some friends that went to school in Charlottesville raving about it. I have even seen someone drop a few lines about Mas in a review for MY favorite tapas place, Estadio in DC.

I finally got my chance to experience Mas when I went to UVa for a football weekend. We went on a Friday night around 9pm so we could eat some tapas and drink some sangria before hitting downtown.

We ended up waiting around 35 minutes so they could accommodate our table of 10 on what appeared to be a busy night. The wait wasn't too bad! The giant jug of Sangria (highly recommended - it's very good) kept us busy until we were ready to be seated.

We were seated outside with a few tables pushed together and everyone was comfortable. The server came around and gave us our menu's and took some drink orders. The menu is VERY extensive so you'll need to take a few minutes looking up and down it. Be careful though because there are so many things that sound amazing.

All of the food we ordered came out in a very reasonable amount of time too!

4/5 - Bacon wrapped dates - I'm not usually a fan of any type of date or bacon wrapped thing. Dates taste weird and usually when things are wrapped in bacon the bacon is still mushy or rubbery. These were a completely different story. The bacon was actually crispy around the date and the entire bite was delicious. Would definitely order these again.

5/5 - Manchego and apples - Obviously not the fanciest thing you can order but the quality of the cheese and apples was fantastic. Both had a ton of flavor and complimented each other very well.

3.5/5 - Jumbo shrimp with garlic aioli - I'm not the biggest fan of in-shell shrimp as I'm more of a butter and garlic drowned shrimp fan but this was still pretty good. Everyone around the table absolutely loved it.

4.5/5 - Carne asada - I will eat steak pretty much any way I can get it. They cook the carne asada rare only but I'm fine with it. It's topped with a smoked tomato aioli that pairs nicely with the rare beef.

5/5 - Octopus and Pork Noodle dish - I'm not sure what this dish was called but it was my favorite of the night by FAR. The pork was tender and the octopus was charred exactly how I like it. Not to mention it was spicy as hell so it was right up my alley. Loved it.

All in all I really enjoyed my meal here and it lived up to expectations. This isn't the fanciest style of tapas you will see out there but the food has just as much flavor as any other place.

Go for the wine selection, which is fairly large and interesting with European wines (I tried the red sangria excitedly, but didn't particularly like it).

If you're looking for an authentic tapas place, this does not quite hit the mark - I would say that it adopts the tapas style with its small plate offerings, but does not quite live up to other tapas restaurants and does not offer the variety of authentic Spanish dishes that you would expect.

We came here in a group of 2 prime time on a Friday night. There was quite a wait, as expected, so we split a bottle of wine as we waited. There wasn't much of a waiting area... I felt bad hovering over other tables as we waited, but there wasn't much of an option as it was too cold to wait outside.

Bar area was first come-first serve, but you kind of have to fight for it. Several people who came after us grabbed seats as soon as people at the bar stood up, so you may want to make clear to others behind you that you're waiting for the bar.

After about 45 minutes wait, we got a table downstairs. While we were waiting, we marked all the tapas we wanted on their paper menu. So, we didn't have to wait too long for our food to come out after we sat. 

All the tapas were soo delicious, so many must-tries!

""Papas Bravas"" - The potatoes with garlic aioli - SO fragrant and yummy, you just keep going back for more. This left us taking small bites just so we could savor it more. It's one of those that's such a simple and basic dish, but somehow I don't think I could replicate it at home.

""Carne asada"" - steak with tomato aioli. Offered in rare only - amazing and delicious! Make sure to dip each bite into the sauce. I'm making myself hungry as I type this...

Some kind of jumbo shrimp - pretty good although probably the least celebrated at our table that night. Not that it wasn't good, just overpowered by everything else that was more amazing. 

Artichoke and goat cheese dip - I really liked this. Although if you're not a big fan of goat cheese, I probably wouldn't recommend. The bread it was served with was extremely hard.. It made it hard to break off to eat with the dip.

Grilled octopus served over bread - cooked perfectly, softened octopus and paired really well with the breading. 

""Datil con tocino"" - bacon wrapped dates. Although it seems an appetizer, it was the last one to arrive at our table, so it acted as our dessert. And it just turned out to be perfect that way, as it's a little savory, a little sweet. Charred smokey taste and just so good. 

So that journey of 6 dishes is enough for you to try an explosion of different flavors, and it came out to about $60 total. Very reasonable price for how great it was!

Fun fact: their special of the night was barnacle. weird right?! We passed this time, but I look forward to to coming back maybe when I'm feeling adventurous and trying one of their other weird specials :P

He will help you appreciate all that is good in the Virginia mountain country.  The wait staff is welcoming and efficient.  There is something on the menu for everyone, including vegans.  The wine selection provides an excellent variety of Spanish reds and whites. The cocktail list is expansive. Try the Basil Gimlet!

Get there early. Mas Tapas does not take reservations.  When we arrived at 5:05 for 5:30 opening, there were already 30 people in line. The wait was well worth it.  Been there twice and will always go back for a pleasant and adventurous experience.

After 35 minutes of sitting without food after eating the initial batch we told our server we were still waiting on 1/3 of our meal, and she never came back.  15 minutes later we were brought our bill by someone else and were told that the orders were never put in by the server and that they probably ""ran out at some point in the night"".  They then brought they last tapa, a set of bacon wrapped dates so charred they were nearly unrecognizable.  We were offered a paltry insincere apology with the caveat that ""this is what happens when it gets late around here"".  Our bill came and nothing was comped and there was no attempt to rectify our experience.  What appeared to be a thoughtfully crafted menu and hip vibe was unfortunately trumped by subpar execution and apathetic and inattentive service.",69.0,Mas Tapas

2017-12-16,5.0,"Definitely one of my favorites in Charlottesville! Food is very high quality, unique, flavorful, and overall heavenly. The menu is quite extensive- so many tapas to pick from! Drinks are great- especially the sangria. 

We started off the simple oven baked bread. It was nice and chewy in the inside and went so well with the olive oil and olives at the table. The ribeye was salted perfectly and served with freshly made basil! Every bite was rich and juicy. Probably my favorite meat dish. The empanada was crispy and the meat inside was spiced perfectly! There's only one empanada for the tapas portion but it's big enough to split it. 

My favorite tapa was the mussels. They were so fresh and juicy, and would have tasted amazing even without the sauce. The sauce, however, is to die for. It's this rich tomato puree that can be served as a nice tomato bisque, except it has all the juices from the mussels. There's a little piece of bread that comes with the dish, perfect for dipping into the sauce. I was surprised by how big this tapa was but even more surprised at how delicious the mussels were (seriously, best mussels I've ever had in my life). 

Patatas bravas are authentic (even better than the ones I've had in Seville actually). The garlic aioli sauce was such a nice combo with the hot, greasy potatoes. Be careful not to burn your tongue! They also make great leftovers and taste just as good microwaved. The carne asada was pretty good, too. Very high quality meat, they put too much sauce and it kind of drowned the entire dish. Finally, we had the truffle grilled cheese sandwich (I forgot the actual name on the menu). The bread was a tad too charred for my liking, but the rich flavor of the truffles and the warm, melted cheese made up for it. A very filling tapa! 

Mas Tapas is a great place to dine! Food is fantastic and will not disappoint. Ambiance is cozy and romantic and service is great. The tapas turned out to be larger than I thought. My boyfriend and I were absolutely stuffed after 7 tapas and had to take the patatas bravas home. There's limited parking in the little lot behind the restaurant. It's popular though, so get there a few minutes before it opens or anticipate a wait!",510.0,Mas Tapas
2018-01-08,4.0,"Without a doubt this is one of the best restaurants in Charlottesville! On the pricier end, for sure, but definitely worth it. 

The food: The sangria is excellent! Be sure to get a large pitcher ($30 and will be enough for about 8 glasses). Our favorite dishes were the Papas Bravas (potatoes with aioli), Queso cocido con alcachofa (artichoke and goat cheese spread), Trinxat (potatoes, cabbage, pork belly, duck fat), and Carne asada (WOW, this was great). The menu is extensive and is broken down into different price points. Our server was great about explaining the menu items and portion sizes to us so we could set expectations and determine how much to order. 

The logistics: They don't take reservations so I would suggest an early dinner or other odd times if you don't like to wait. I came with a group right when they opened at 5:30 and the restaurant was already filling up fairly quickly. This setting also isn't great for groups - they don't seat until the entire party is present and they don't split checks. The plates are fairly difficult to share with groups larger than 4 unless you're okay getting only a bite (or sometimes even half a bite) of certain dishes. However, for a date, this restaurant is perfect!

2018-04-04,5.0,"THE BIG: Located on the corner of Monticello and Carlton. Medium sized restaurant with no prior reservations aka first come first serve. There are outdoor seating, but only when it's nice outside. Street parking is available.

THE BLACK AND WHITE: We came here on a nice March night. Outside was still cold so none of the patio section was open but I can definitely picture a cool summer night with tapas and sangria.

I'm pretty sure there's always a wait because when we got here (~5:45pm), there were already 7 tables in front of us...and people still kept showing up. It took us about 45 minutes to get seated, thankfully we got a pitcher of sangria to hold us over. $30 for a large pitcher that serves 8 glasses, not bad.

---As for the food---
-Cauliflower: Curry flavored and essentially dissolved in your mouth
-Papas Bravas: The garlic aioli was dope and the potatoes were nicely cubed out
-Scallop: Just one scallop but it was done right. Had big roe pieces on top and a potato-ey spread below it. 
-Bacon-wrapped Dates: Sweet meets savory. Only comes with 4
-Carne Asada: Evenly cooked-cut steak with a nice serving of a buttery yellow sauce on top 

THE FINAL BAMBOO: When the dust settled, $100.93 was spent including tip/tax. That's what tapas does to you, but damn was this worth it.",880.0,Mas Tapas
2018-04-08,3.0,"We were first in line at 5:20pm, and by 5:45 there was a LONG line out the door. Tapas is one of my favorite types of food and seeing the hype, I was quite excited to try out Mas. Here are the items we shared:

- goat cheese artichoke dip: fine, not amazing; strong on chevre
- jamon: incredible quality but VERY small, sad pieces and very pricey (around $15) for what we got. 
- bacon wrapped dates: hard to mess this one up. good but I've had much bigger bacon wrapped dates elsewhere 
- lamb meatballs: good flavor but fell apart easily
- shrimp: very plump and grilled well, served with incredibly thick aioli
- carne asada: cooked well but I was disappointed by how the dish came out cold. who wants their meat served not hot? 

I did not order a drink, but my friends' sangria and cocktail were reportedly watered down and not very good. 

Overall, food was only okay and very pricey. We left feeling very confused by the line still out the door now being told for a wait of 2-2.5 hrs. definitely not worth the value or wait imo, I'd much rather dine at little john's or mellow mushroom pizza when in Charlottesville...",502.0,Mas Tapas
2018-06-03,2.0,"Came to Charlottesville from Northern Virginia and was stocked to try this place all weekend! So disappointed and kind of odd with all the other great reviews. 

Service: 2 of 5 - The moment we walked in the door we were rudely greeted and our information was taken down for the waitlist. Had 3 parties ahead of us and asked for a rough ballpark of estimated wait time and was abruptly told ""they don't give estimates"" as the girl rushed off. Okay, I get it - can't give wait times but she came across really inappropriately and almost made me want to walk out the door. Our actual server wasn't too bad. 

Food: 3 of 5 - I get it, this place puts a hipster vibe on Spanish Tapas but the authenticity was a poor excuse for the rendering of the concept. My boyfriend (who is Salvadoran) even noticed that the beer on their menu and country of origin listed were incorrect (pretty much a slap in the face) to Spanish culture. 

Value: 2 of 5 - Tried this spot on a mini-vacation and spent over $200 with drinks included for the two of us. The only dish that was remotely decent was the artichoke and goat cheese dip. Too bad this was the first dish we put in order in for and the very last thing we were served.

I don't know, I'll give them benefit of the doubt and maybe we caught them on a bad night but overLl a very poor experience. Will not be returning.",106.0,Mas Tapas
2018-06-24,1.0,"My friends and I were very excited about our trip to this restaurant. The entire time on our walk there, we discussed how happy we were to try this place. One of my friends, it was her birthday, had chosen this restaurant because she had always heard good things. I did not know much about it, but being from the Charlottesville area, I was familiar with the location. So, I knew the area wasn't going to be all that racially diverse thanks to all of the gentrification around the Belmont area. 

When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a host who urged us to choose a seat inside, so there would be less of a wait. We complied and were squeezed at a table in the rear of the restaurant. A waitress soon approached us and offered up a few friendly suggestions on what we should order. We let her know that two of my friends were vegetarians and that I was allergic to selfish, so we would have to steer clear of those options. She then proceeded to lecture me on carrying my epipen everywhere I go. This has never happened to me at a restaurant. i have also never been spoken to in such a condescending way by someone before. I have gone to many restaurants and told wait staff about my allergy and they are usually very understanding. This waitress was not. She made it seem like I had inconvenienced the entire restaurant. She very unenthusiastically said ""I'll have to run everything by the kitchen now.""

The rest of the meal was uncomfortable. I cannot remember if I even liked the taste of the food. All I can remember is a white woman yelling at me because of my food allergies. My advice to anyone who is interested in tapas in the Charlottesville area. Try Bang! It's within walking distance of this tone-deaf place and is actually quite delicious. There aren't weird photos of white people doing yoga on the walls and I was treated with respect and courtesy while I was. Moral of the story: Skip this place. It's expensive. They're rude. And you can definitely get a better meal somewhere else.

Their menu changes seasonally which means they always have something new and different to try. There are a few many staples, like the complimentary olives to start the meal and the bacon wrapped dates (we order them as dessert). I enjoy ordering a number of things (T/tapas size) so I can try more things. Most recently their scallop with corned cream was my favorite dish. I also love their selection of Spanish wines- especially how many they have by the glass!

We ordered a half dozen tapas from the vegetarian options available. Food came out pretty quickly and everything was very flavorful. The seasoning profile is pretty similar across all the items we ordered - olive oil, paprika, harrisa, etc. They are going for authentic Spanish tapas, which we appreciated. The patatas bravas were not like I am used to - small crispy potatoes - but rather big soft hunks in sauce. Bill was less than $100, but we did not order alcohol or meat.

Yes, they do not take reservations, so get there early and make sure your entire party is present.

Our table was ready around 7:30 at which time I was already drooling and planning what to order as I watched the chefs send out various dishes to their respective tables. 

It seems as if their menu is overwhelming with options, but the staff are always willing to explain and give their suggestions. Based on that, I ordered the carne asada for sure! The meat was so tender and flavorful, I almost wanted to order another, but had to save room for the other dishes. (All of their dishes come in two sizes!) The papas bravas and the brussel sprouts were warm and extremely flavorful with their sauces. The shrimp was also very good.

While its definitely worth trying, it didn't quite meet our expectations with many of the plates being a little underwhelming for the cost.  I wish I could tell you what plates we got but the menu is near indecipherable with names you'll never be able to remember (even immediately after ordering).  So you will place your order on the sheet provided for the table and then be surprised as the plates you order come out randomly.

Décor wise mas tapas is kind of all over the place.  When you walk it works hard to evoke that certain posh atmosphere with semi-uniformed / dressed-up staff to greet and serve you.  There's a nice variety of seating options with a neat, second room down a flight of stairs. Tapas also has a beautiful long bar for those looking to grab a quick seat.  Myself and the two women I was with agreed that the art on the wall was a little confusing.  I'm having problems remembering what I saw but it was an odd mash up of  overly sexual close-up photos.  

Drink wise I was happy with the dirty martini I received and the girls liked the wine options available to them.  Foodwise, we ordered a bread and cheese plate which came with slices of green apple.  While everything was good quality the presentation was pretty plain and underwhelming.  We liked the baked wings and I enjoyed the thin slice of rare beef.  Everyone loved the potatoes au gratin although the ladies commented that it was presented differently than they were used to.  Flavor-wise it was exceptional.  The goat cheese cheese cake was also very unique.

2019-08-13,3.0,"I had high hopes for Mas because it appeared on several Charlottesville restaurant lists, had great Yelp reviews, and was recommended by my husband who had an memorable meal here a couple of years ago. Unfortunately (and my husband would agree) that the food came up short this time. 

It was our first meal in Charlottesville after over 3 hours of driving in rush hour traffic from DC, so we were hungry and ready to be easily impressed. Our server, who reminded me of the leader singer of Muse, recommended a bunch of dishes and we ordered all of them: the cauliflower, papas bravas, tortilla Espanola​, grilled artichoke hearts with garlic aioli​, wild gulf shrimp, heirloom carrots, and ""ginormous"" sea scallop with parsnip & celery root puree. The cauliflower came out first and it raised the bar sky high. Roasted in coconut milk, ginger, turmeric, sweet onions, and sea salt, it was the best rendition of cauliflower I've ever had. I found myself trying to commit its subtle but warm and rich flavor to memory so that I could try to recreate it. Sadly, as the rest of the tapas came out, the bar set by the cauliflower quickly came crashing down. The carrots were undercooked, the papas bravas were mushy, the artichokes tasted like they were from a can, and the ""ginormous"" sea scallop was not ginormous enough to warrant a $14 price tag. These tapas tasted like they were made by a completely different caliber restaurant than the one that made the cauliflower. The gulf shrimp briefly interrupted the lackluster lineup. Large, juicy, and perfectly seasoned, they could stand on their own without the smooth garlic aioli that it sat on top of. I was particularly surprised that out of over 40 different tapas on the menu, our server did not recommend better ones. Not sure if he was upselling us (such as with the scallop) or trying to get rid of less popular ingredients. 

Thankfully the night ended on a sweet note with a delightful flourless chocolate cake. And the entire night was saved by the stellar gin cocktails and the chill, hipster atmosphere that made us feel young, cool, and transported from DC. 

Our bill came out to be ~$65pp with tax and tip which was about 20% more than I expected. I would consider giving Mas another try to cobble together a better tasting, better value lineup of tapas. If I fail to recreate their cauliflower, I'll have to.",46.0,Mas Tapas

After speaking to the manager our drinks and starter were comped, but still felt as though the reason for our concerns were not fully understood.

We both started with a cup of regular coffee. Minor complaint is that it didn't appear to be a bottomless cup. However we did order drinks for our meal, so maybe the server just assumed we didn't want more. 

For the meal I had the shrimp with polenta and a blood orange mimosa. All was great. While I had plenty to eat, for the price I thought my portion was a bit small. He had the biscocho jamon (Serrano ham and egg biscuit) plus a side of papas bravas y alioli (fried potatoes with aioli) and a Bloody Mary. The price/portion was better and all was delicious. 


I would definitely return and try other things on the menu and the speed with which were served would make it great for brunch to take the kids.",207.0,Mas Tapas

I had never been to this part of town but saw this place on Yelp so I figured I would check it out when I was on one of my frequent business trips to Charlottesville.

There's a small parking lot behind the restaurant which is nice.

Inside it's not very big but attractive. I just sat at the bar, which pretty much runs the length of the restaurant.

I was on my own so I started with the arugula salad and was pleased. There were several things that interested me but next I settled on the buratta-pesto-toast tapas thing and that was also good.
I debated ordering something else but decided to just get dessert instead.

I ordered the flan just because and honesty it exceeded my expectations. Cappuccino was also legit.

Service was fine and it wasn't very busy the night I was there. 

Only downside was I thought it was a bit expensive. The aforementioned salad and one tapas, glass of inexpensive wine and a cappuccino was north of $50 and honestly I was still a little hungry.

But all in all I will probably be back to spend more of my company's money.",279.0,Mas Tapas

As far as our personal recommendations - we've never gone wrong with arugula salad, carne asada, grilled tuna (always perfectly rare), gambas (shrimp), bouqerones(anchovies), papas bravas (perfectly roasted potatoes), and the pla' piqueno (amazing manchego thinly sliced, served with housebaked bread and apples - yum!) all of which have been available for take-out at this time.

The take out service is super easy where they bring the food right to your car. The food itself was delish. Didn't take a picture because plating is not my strong suit but we ordered: 

- carne asada: Cooked perfectly, our favorite tapa
- coliflor: SO GOOD. Got turned onto this after trying it at conmole across the street a big who and I have to say, both places do an amazing job
- bacon wrapped dates: only came with 4 (two screens of two) but so good 
- hongos: these were a little weird. Tasty, but kind of odd 
- papas bravas: usually one of my favorites, although I wasn't super impressed here in comparison to the other food. Still definitely good though! 
- sangria: YUM! One order was perfect for 2 glasses

It's incredibly difficult to get reservations now because there are only 5 tables and the seating is 1hr 45min long. We felt rushed by our server so we picked 2 dishes right away to start: chorizo and carne asada. The carne asada ended up being one of the better dishes and our favorite- caution, the meat may still be mooing. The chorizo was good, but definitely have had better. The posole (chicken stew) was bland and unimpressive...waste of stomach space. Then, we ordered the chuletas (lamb chops) and pescado (rockfish), which offered some promising flavors. The fish happened to be the table favorite. The bocato (pork cheek) was my personal favorite. Having some room left after all these dishes, we cumulatively decided to order 2 more dishes: pintxo (rabbit pate) and oyster mushrooms. Both of these dishes were awful and a disappointing end to our dinner. We basically forced our bites to finish our plates. The pate was a runny gravy slopped onto bread. And the mushrooms ruined it all from there.

2021-03-11,3.0,"We were so looking forward to this dinner due to several recommendations with some rave reviews and as such had high expectations. Sadly, our dinner overall was a let down.
We started off with chorizo which was disappointing and carne asada. Having had chorizo at different Spanish / Hispanic restaurants, this one was mediocre. It lacked the spice of a typical highly seasoned Spanish pork sausage. The tenderloin that came with a warning of being grilled VERY RARE , was on point, delicious and definitely one of the best carne asada , according to my husband. The aioli with it brought out the flavor even more. 
We then moved on to Posole - chicken stew which was supposed  to have a nice blend of onions & poblano peppers which would have given it a nice distinctive taste. We thought it was just meh..
We also ordered Bocato which was braised pork cheeks with a delicious meld of flavors in a brioche. We loved it!
Another winner was the pescado which was a tasty, slightly crispy seared rockfish - definitely a must have!
The chuletas (baby lamb chops) unfortunately failed to impress. We think they were overly trimmed of fat.
We wanted to try something else so we ordered the Pintxo and the Hongos. We shouldn't have. Both dishes were unimpressive. The rabbit liver - black truffle pate was a tasteless gray smear on bread. The grilled mushrooms were neither interesting nor good. A shame that it was the last taste in our mouths at the end of our meal.

Tuna Salad - nice mix of arugula with plenty of chunks of yellowfin tuna plus capers, onions, and shaved manchego cheese. Super tasty. 

Albondigas - juicy beef/pork/lamb meatballs in a very flavorful romesco sauce.
 
Carne Asada - seared perfectly and then basically rare. My wife and I like it that way, but I'm sensitive that others like their beef cooked more.

Arroz con Pollo - I'm not sure if the chicken was smoked or the pepper in the sofrito, but this dish had a very nice smoky note to it.

Hummus - good pepper and garlic flavors in this version.

We finally got a chance to check out this Belmont staple again since moving back, and this time we brought friends. Doing so allowed us to sample even more of the menu. Happily, we found the food here as good as ever.

Dining with a party of four allowed us to sample nine different tapas, and not one was a dud. Some of our favorites included tender baby lamb chops paired with a zesty chimichurri, a tender roast octopus, a crock of creamy goat cheese-artichoke dip (perfect with the house crusty bread), and Mas's take on the classic patatas bravas (with roasted rather than fried spuds). While still good, some of the slightly less successful dishes we tried included the mussels (difficult to manage at a small table, and not the freshest) and the tortilla (eggs a bit overcooked and underseasoned). Though we ordered 9 dishes, they came out in waves of three which made negotiating the limited real estate at our tiny table feasible. 

The drink program here focuses on, unsurprisingly, Spanish wine with a tight selection of draft beer and some cocktails. My wife enjoyed her wine, though my cocktail was strictly okay. While a meal here can get pricey, I find that the ingredients generally of high quality and the overall cost subsequently reasonable.

The colts de bruselas were cheesy with delicious crispy bacon and delicate hints of rosemary. The mejilones were as good as I have tasted with a delectable thin sauce. The ensalada de atun had fresh tuna and a light dressing perfectly applied to the salad. The gambacitos al ajillo were divine with a scrumptious sauce.

The drinks were pretty standard (still wonderful), and were decorated nicely. No complaints here.

SERVICE
Our server was very kind. When our order didn't arrive for the hour we were there, he took it off our check. He also explained the vegetarian items available very well and sold us on the restaurant at large.

We ordered three salads which we thought were different dishes and our server failed to inform us that arugula was the only the main ingredient. The meatballs were just chorizo with a few shreds of manchego when they were supposed to be a blend of beef and pork.

2023-07-28,1.0,"RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL MANAGER! ALEX on Saturdays!

Is Alex a female  cause she likes to bark at customers...

I recently dined at Mas Tapas. We were placed at an awkward table b/c the table reserved for us had issues. Since we were seated in an awkward space, I went up to the host stand to see if we could sit in another area since there was ample open seating. As I'm speaking... Alex, their Saturday manager, cuts me off mid-sentence. She barked, ""NO."" at me, looked me dead in the face, and continued with her matters. I was stunned. Never have I been spoken to that way by service staff especially when it was completely uncalled for and unprompted.

Your stress levels do not give you a pass to mistreat people. I've worked in the service industry before and I NEVER treated guests that way. If any team member did so, they would be fired. It was very clear that one of their younger servers (who was such a pleasure) felt so uncomfortable. He tried to make it right... which is why I believe we got a few free drinks.

Alex never apologized... she continued to prance around like she's all that. Sorry to say, if you can't treat people with respect ESPECIALLY in the service industry... You are not all that and you have no business being in hospitality.

Mas Tapas, the food was good but if your establishment doesn't have good people... your customers will dwindle.",32.0,Mas Tapas

If you like cocktails, their basil martini is wonderful, but you can also order a pitcher of sangria that will keep you and your party pretty happy as well. Tapas can get expensive because you will want to order everything on the menu. The bread they serve with their pâté also delicious.

2024-02-03,2.0,"Yeeks... hate to give a poor review from a place I have always thought was the best. But tonight at Mas, the food was sad. The garlic shrimp was a big bowl of popcorn shrimp floating in sauce- like probably 20 shrimp, where it should have been 4 or so nice jumbo shrimp.  Sauce was okay but the garlic sauce I make at home kills this one. And that baby shrimp all curled in balls is so off putting. The lamb lollipops - the meat portion was a small as a nickel. I know lamb lollipops well and I know they are small but these were super super small.  The tomato bread was inedible. It was more like Italian bruschetta than Spanish tomato bread which would have been fine but the tomatoes were smoked and it was like a whole bottle of liquid smoke had been poured on them. It left a film in your mouth that you couldn't get rid of. It was way way too smoky and also a disappointment that it wasn't traditional Spanish tomato bread. The octopus was good in itself but served on a huge bed of very overwhelming romesco sauce. It needed maybe 6-8 dots of that sauce along the rim, but the sheer volume of that very strong sauce just overwhelmed the delicate octopus. Each dish that was laid in front of us was so poorly presented and ""off"" from the beauty and unctuousness of what nice tapas should be and used to be here.  The only good dish was a jamon and manchego on a roll- like a little sandwich. That and the wine were the only good parts of our meal tonight  as what used to be my favorite tapas restaurant ever. .",90.0,Mas Tapas
2024-03-24,5.0,"My mom and I came here on a Saturday night for a nice dinner on our way home from Williamsburg. Mas Tapas has been in Charlottesville for a while and is very highly regarded. The menu consists of tapas and Spanish styled food. You can order the food in a tapas size or a racion size, which is double the size of the tapa serving. We ended up splitting a variety of tapa dishes and left comfortably full. The interior is fun with an abstract flair to it. The service was busy, could have been more attentive. We didn't have a reservation and were lucky to get one of the last spots available at the bar. We both enjoyed eating at the bar and it allowed us to see them preparing all the dishes!

We ordered several things at once and they came freshly prepared and were served straight from the chefs. They were also spaced out nicely, we didn't receive everything at once but we didn't have to wait too long in between the tapas either. The jamon y queso came first which was a plate with ample amounts of jamon serrano reserva and manchego cheese. You can never go wrong with high quality meat and cheese, and this certainly didn't disappoint! The meat was similar to a prosciutto and paired magically with the sharp manchego cheese. The ensalada lechuga came next and it included baby lettuces, toasted pine nuts, sultanas, manchego cheese, and a mango vinaigrette. The salad was simple and light, but had great flavor, especially from the tangy mango dressing. After the salad, the coliflor arrived. It was cauliflower roasted with coconut milk, ginger, turmeric, and grey salt. Probably some of the most flavorful cauliflower we've ever eaten. The turmeric was delightful and added a complexity to an otherwise boring vegetable. The aueso y alcachofa and papas bravas arrived next. Both these dishes were absolutely amazing. The potatoes were cooked to perfection, with slightly crisp skins and a soft, fluffy interior. They were roasted with harissa and herbs, topped with a garlic aioli. The harissa added a slight spiciness to them and the creamy garlic aioli complimented the heat very well. Highly, highly recommend. The queso y alcachofa plate was a spinach artichoke like dip with roasted artichoke hearts, sweet onions, garlic, herbs, and goat cheese, served with their house made bread. This was outstanding! The goat cheese elevated the flavor of the artichokes so much and added some tang to it. The bread was heavenly and was perfect for serving the dip on. We decided to order a couple more items, included the lamburgeusa and the carne asada. The lamburguesa was a lamb and beef slider with feta, salsa especial, baby lettuces, served on a brioche roll with pickled veggies. The was a super flavorful slider and the brioche bun was downright amazing. The feta cheese was strong, but complimented the flavorful meat and sweetness of the bun. Last was the carne asada, arguably the most impressive tapa we had! The carne asada was grilled extremely rare to perfection, served with a duck fat tortilla topped with a herbaceous mojo verde sauce. Words cannot do justice for how perfectly cooked this steak was and just how much flavor it had. It was tender, with a nice char. The sauce overtop of it only amplified the flavor of the steak. We did end up ordering their chocolate sangria torte. It was essentially a flourless chocolate torte with a sangria flavor to it. The sangria was subtle, but present, and the raspberry coulee worked nicely with the richness of the chocolate. A great way to finish our amazing dinner!

All in all, we left full, very impressed, and more than satisfied! Everything we ordered had immense, unique, bold flavors that left us wowed. Each dish was different from the next and portioned perfectly. You can tell they really prioritize using high quality ingredients and it reflects in the flavors of the food. The restaurant has a cool vibe to it with pops of color and abstract art. While the service could have been more attentive, it wasn't poor. We will definitely be returning to Mas Tapas if we are in the are again and look forward to trying more of their eclectic tapas!",116.0,Mas Tapas

Otherwise, the chicken and rice was very tasty and a large portion, as was the tuna, chicken wings, and mussels.  The carne asada was delicious.

2024-07-07,2.0,"Mas fell as flat as their 50 dollar Sangria. This used to be one of our favorite restaurants in Charlottesville, but it has fallen on hard times.

The Sangria was 50 bucks. Not a typo. Not 15 bucks. It tasted like a 5 dollar bottle of bad red wine with a few slices of fruit. Traditionally, a little brandy is added or sugar or something to bring out the flavor or liven it up. We ordered a little ginger ale to keep it from tasting like flat cheap wine

The olives were serviceable.

The bread and Machego was a half loaf of dry baguette and two pieces of manchego sliced like American cheese.

The atun(tuna) and arugula was similarly bland. Needed salt and some lemon may have helped.

Papas bravas is usually a staple of Spanish tapas. Roasted fingerling potatoes with an aioli or other sauce. Their variant had spicy harrissa sauce and aioli and might have been a good dish... If they remembered to add any salt. We asked our server for a small bowl of coarse sea salt or finishing salt. That little pinch made a huge difference.

Next was albondigas with romesco. This is meatballs with a pureed red pepper and garlic sauce, or it should be. We received the tiniest dried meatballs which were clearly overcooked. The were served in a thin oily gravy that bore little or no resemblance to romesco.

The datil or dates wrapped with bacon, lacked both the saltiness or the sweetness whose combination generally make this a favorite

The grilled pulpo(octopus) had thin caliber pieces with a rubbery texture. Again, the dish lacked salt and that necessary lemon, which might have brightened it up and brought out the flavors better.

The restaurant was not crowded but service was substandard. Nobody asked how the food was nor did they make the appropriate number of inquiries to see if we needed or wanted anything else.

Relative to other restaurants in Charlottesville, I think the Local has the best pricing for awesome food. - all in all, a PERFECT semi-formal DATE SPOT.

FOOD: fresh and sourced locally! Hence this place's name. I think they've truly perfected the flavors here. Of what I've tried, the pork chops are great as are the roasted cauliflower and their steak. Their berry cobbler dessert is delicious as well. The fact that I've been here 3 times and have enjoyed my dishes every single time gives this place a 100% in my books.

SERVICE: So kind and so knowledgeable! I forget my servers name but everyone around us commented how awesome he was and their desire to tip him well. - white guy with brown curly hair!

One of the best things about this place is that there is so much ample space! It's absolutely great for large, large parties and there a ton of starter platters that can be made to share. 

It's a bit pricey to be eating here regularly, and the semi-formal vibe makes it difficult to justify as an easy option for dinner.

The only reason I'm deducting a star is because our waitress acted super weird when the majority of us ordered pasta instead of entrees. She goes ""you guys and your pasta!

Atmosphere - I love the ambiance. The downstairs is sort of a classic wooden rustic bar area, and the upstairs is more of an open concept fancier restaurant with twinkle lights. If you have any family or friends visiting from out of town, this is a perfect place to take them for a nice, but casual night out with dinner and drinks.

Service - The service has always been super quick and the wait staff is extremely attentive, even when it's a busy Friday or weekend night.

Parking - There's not much parking in front, but there is a neighborhood on the parallel street over with ample amounts of street parking.

Most importantly, FOOD - I'm not a vegetarian, but I don't eat much meat. I LOVE their Truffled Mushroom Ragout. It's so creamy and rich without being too heavy. I usually get the double/larger portion so that I can take it home and have it for leftovers the next day for lunch!

Cheaper 'date night' prices, pretty solid food, super close and convenient.... overall Local is worth trying out. 

We followed the waiter's recommendations and got the crispy shrimp and flash-fried sprouts as apps.  Shrimp were something you can find anywhere (i.e. bonefish) but the fried sprouts were pretty tasty.  For dinner I had the fried local chicken and she had the salmon.  Her fish was good, but the underlying rice was super goopy and tasted like it was cooked in a crockpot with canned cream'o mushroom soup. My chicken had some excellent flavor but the bulk of my meat portion was just fried chicken skin with minimal actual meat. We also had a side of Gus but with only 6 spears for $6... you'll want to skip those. Lastly, our server was friendly but kinda hard to understand b/c he worked&talked at the speed of light.

The staff is friendly, attentive, and they make great recommendations. We were unsure on which wine to split and our waiter spoke openly about which was what we were looking for without clearly encouraging us to only go for the most expensive bottles.

The top deck has great string lights which makes for a great atmosphere. Inside cleanliness and decor are top notch. They find a great mix of casual and formal. Wearing a dress or wearing jeans and a nice top both work for the atmosphere.

The food. That alone earns the five stars. The lobster Mac and cheese came highly recommended and when I say they don't skimp they definitely don't. I split a dinner portion with my friend and we still couldn't finish it all. It comes topped with cheese and such large chunks of lobster we found ourselves cutting it into smaller portions so we could enjoy more noodles.

2020-03-02,4.0,"After looking into a few restaurants for my friend's birthday dinner in Charlottesville, we decided on The Local. When you walk in, you were welcomed into a restaurant with a cozy and calm ambience, complimented with a wooden floor and brick wall interior to create a ""homey feeling."" We were seated upstairs, which ended up being more spacious than we expected. For a Saturday night, this place was packed. It seemed to be a more family oriented restaurant based on the patrons this evening.

For the food, we decided to split the Fried Brussels and Cauliflower. Although the waitress recommended we get two, one plate was more than enough for the five of us. The cauliflower was cooked to perfection, but the brussels were not as tender as I expected. Also, there was flavor in this starter, I think there needed to be a counterpoint to it given it was just had a sharp tangy taste that lacked any sort of spice. 

Our entree orders: The Ceasar Salad was fairly standard, but the Goat Cheese salad was the perfect mix of ingredients created a sweet yet savory salad experience. Both had the right amount of dressing to not oversaturate the greens. Amazing pick. Another great option was the Gnocchi Bolognese. The gnocchi were melt in your mouth pillows saturated in a creamy meat sauce. The Truffle Mushroom Ragout was also drenched in creamy flavor, although it was a little bland (but to be expected based on the simple ingredients). The Veggie Burger, also fairly delicious, came with a whole appetizer size portion of burrata- it was incredible. The Duck Breast was incredibly succelent, and the only issue was that of the appetizier- the lack of tenderness in the brussel sprouts. 

As a tip, a couple of us just got the salads and a half portion of pasta thinking we might still be hungry, but honestly this amount was plenty and very cost effective.

All in all, you really get what you paid for here, as we all had some leftover food but were pretty stuffed towards the end of the meal.

The 3 of us basically fought over the pieces, smearing them against the delicious sauce. For entrees, we had the fried chicken, short rib, and pork chop. The pork chop was the unanimous favorite amongst all the plates. Each bite had a little fat with it to make it tasty, and I loved that it came with a big fat bone to gnaw on.

I loved the art on the walls, they were so fun to look at. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. The service is quick, even when they're super busy! You should definitely make a reservation (it was somewhat difficult for us to get a spot).

-Farmer's Tan 8/10: a really pretty color, but I didn't really love the taste
-Crab Soup 9/10: very delicious!
-Fresh Burrata 10/10: loved all these flavors! Highly recommend this for an appetizer
-Beef Tenderloin 9/10: this was one of their specials, and it was so delicious! I really enjoyed their flavors and it was all cooked perfectly
-Local ""River Oaks Farm"" Chicken 8/10: the chicken was amazing- I'd give the chicken alone a 10/10. The mac and cheese was a delicious complement to it. I didn't enjoy the collard greens- they used some spice that made it sweet, which I wasn't expecting and didn't really enjoy, but other than that the plate was great!
-New York Style Cheesecake 9/10: I really enjoyed this! The hazelnut crust was especially amazing.

2021-08-13,5.0,"Came here with a friend for dinner. The food was great, and I loved my experience. The restaurant consists of two floors and has nice outdoor seating on both. The inside of the restaurant has a cozy atmosphere with warm lighting and exposed brick. I also love how the interior supports local artist's paintings and stain glass works.

We ordered Crispy Shrimp Appetizer, Sauvignon Blanc, Meatloaf, Gnocchi Bolognese, and House Made Blackberry Cobbler. The Crispy Shrimp was lightly fried, cooked well, and tasted great in the sauces. The seaweed salad that came with it also complimented the dish nicely.

The Gnocchi was perfectly cooked and had a nice bite to it. The sauce was hearty, and the overall dish was delicious. The Meatloaf was awesome. The bacon was a nice touch, and it was one of the best meatloafs I've ever had. The mashed potatoes and green beans were also cooked well. It's a great meat and potatoes dish. The entrees we ordered were 17 dollars each and I thought the portions and quality were great for the price.

For dessert, we tried the House Made Blackberry Cobbler. It was probably the most underwhelming order of the night; however, it wasn't bad. I would have liked a nicer crust on the top and bottom because I couldn't really find any crust. I also would have liked the blackberry filling to be thicker because the consistency was more on the liquid side with solid pieces of blackberry sitting inside. However, I thought the vanilla ice cream was good and it was freshly made which I liked.

Overall, I enjoyed my food and dining experience here. I love how The Local embodies their namesake as a locally owned business that sources ingredients from locally owned and operated farms, and even showcases local artists in their restaurant design. The dishes were great for the portions and price. The restaurant is a new favorite for me in the area and I can't wait to come back.",372.0,The Local
2021-08-19,5.0,"I took the recommendations of the restaurant employees and ordered the shrimp appetizer with seaweed salad ($12) and the salmon ($23) as my entree. Being from Florida, I wasn't quite sure about ordering all seafood at an inland location, but the restaurant really delivered a delicious meal. The shrimp is fried in a light batter and the salmon has a wonderful crust. Overcooked seafood can be so disappointing, but the salmon was cooked perfectly. The fish flaked while still having moisture, a perfect medium rare salmon, just the way I like it. Salmon is such a wonderful fish, but over cooking it just a bit can transform its flavor from being delicate to very fishy and strong. So kudos to the chef, because not only was my piece cooked perfectly, so was the second order I took home . The restaurant is cozy and has a lot of outdoor seating, mostly shaded. Definitely going to be a regular spot for me in the coming years. A good place to go when family comes to visit!

My entree was the Local fried chicken - which was tender & juicy & fell off the bone- with a bomb pimento cheese macaroni and flavorful collards. The hot sauce drizzle really made the plate.

Our server Stella was great- I'm a server as well and could tell she was clearly working so hard but still made an effort to take time with us and was very kind! 

Our only somewhat critical comment was that we initially got seated in the wine barn next to the main restaurant but it was very cold due to the doors keeping opening, and it was clearly mostly meant for groups - there were 2 parties of 8+ sitting inches from our table - that the ambiance was awful. Their loud laughing and cheers-ing did not make for a date night ambiance like we were hoping for, and made us feel like intruders to the parties. Luckily, we asked our initial server if we could move to another table elsewhere and he was very accommodating and quickly moved us to a great table in the main restaurant area next to the bar.

The menu options change seasonally, so there is always something new and delicious to try. The flavor combinations are inventive and completely unique from any over Charlottesville restaurant. I got the pork chop, which was incredibly moist and perfectly seasoned with a chili rub. It was accompanied by mashed potatoes and sweet potato shoestrings, which had a delightful texture and flavor. The portion sizes were just right, and I had just enough room to split a dessert. We chose the mango cheesecake, which was smooth, creamy, and light.

We finished the night off with the flourless chocolate cake which was good but I think we should have ordered something else (that's on us).

The restaurant itself is beautiful, styled with local art available for purchase. The standout here to me was actually the service! The host and server were incredibly friendly and helpful, answering questions and accommodating special requests -- we ordered the cheese plate with breads separate for a gluten allergy and they made sure to do that and warn us about any contact allergens for other menu items. I really felt welcomed by them. 

The cocktails were also quite excellent. We ordered a few to try, but the Death in the Afternoon was a must-order (for lovers of Absinthe). The .38 Special was excellent as well.  

For appetizers we sampled a few, the fried brussels sprouts had to be the best. If you come here, make sure you order that. The cheese plate was really great as well, with a good selection of local cheeses. 

We ordered a variety of entrees as well, everything from the seafood pasta to the burger to the steak. Everything was tasty, the steak and salmon being especially well received. We ended the meal with a peanut butter brownie, which was rich and enough to share with all five of us after all the other ordering we did!

The one drawback with this restaurant is that it is pricey. It was a really fun place to go splurge for a special occasion -- birthday dinner for us -- but maybe not the spot for a general meal.

The Food:
*.38 Cocktail - I love whiskey and old fashioned's and this one certainly impressed. I'm not a fan of ginger (one of the ingredients), but whatever they did with this drink it certainly worked. Highly recommended.

*crispy shrimp - great and tasty appetizer. If you love Asian food and flavors, then you'll likely love this one. The seaweed salad was unexpectedly very tasty.

*pork belly - This was good and had plenty of flavor but I'd warn anyone who isn't a fan of meat with a fatty cut. There was a bit too much for my wife's liking but we still enjoyed it.

*Buffalo Creek Beef short ribs - Loved it and it's as good as everyone says it is. Tender, flavorful, and filling! If you are considering it, go ahead and order it. 

*Tenderloin - This was an item on the special menu that night and my wife enjoyed every bite. The portion size was also impressive and she was defeated by it.

Sat at the bar and had a bean dish topped with an egg and what I believe was a Cajun style sausage. It was delicious! It had some spices I couldn't quite identify but it was really good. I would put it in the comfort food category. The portion was not large (not small but I hadn't eaten all day) so I also ordered the side dish of carrots.

The carrots may have been the best I ever tried! They were grilled with some type of nut and a thin sauce that was delicious. Also very pretty multi colors of carrots. If you come here you have to try them.

Service was attentive and friendly- I was alone so I ate at the bar.

The only downside is that the wine was a little disappointing- I wish I would have went with beer as it appeared they had a much better selection.

They also have a very extensive selection of mixed drinks and spirits. I tried an old fashioned but I was also a little disappointed with that. The bartender noticed and didn't charge me. Even so, this is an expensive place if you drink, although I thought the food was reasonable for the area.

Call ahead early for a reservation. The tables on the front right side are going to be close to the host or hostess. Try to sit closer towards the back or over to the left to avoid hearing their conversations with guests during your dinner.

The food: it's made with locally grown produce and is very fresh.

2023-02-16,4.0,"Between a 3 and a 4 for The Local. Although nothing was outright bad about dinner here, it left a lot to be desired. Each part of the dinner wasn't quite right:
-My cocktail glass was under filled (especially for $13)
-Appetizer (cheese board) was more basic than expected and had greens/lettuce as filler
-Entrees were overdone and on the bland side
-Dessert was missing a component listed on the menu
 Each part just felt lackluster and overall missing extra flavor and intention/thoughtfulness. Not a bad restaurant for decent, casual food and very nice service, but it's not the place for a fun/special occasion experience that feels well crafted despite what its website appears to claim. 
I really appreciate their focus on local ingredients and wanted to like this place because of that, but it could do much more given the price point and supposed reputation.",12.0,The Local

My preference would be to sit upstairs, which seemed less crowded, but still had exposed brick and wood.  Let's get to the food:  ample portions, deliciously prepared.

The trout dish offered two large fillets, surrounded by crispy crawfish over top of greens...collards I believe.  The latter, ample in portion, would have filled my green desire, but the preparation was quite vinegary, typical in southern cooking, but an odd taste for me. A touch crispy on the fried bits.

There was a pre fixe menu for graduation weekend, I chose the goat cheese salad, beef tenderloin, and cheesecake. The portions were incredibly small for the set price that doesn't even include drinks. The steak was extremely well done and unseasoned despite the sauce on top that was bitter. I prefer a medium rare but we were not asked how we wanted our steaks prepared. It was tough and difficult to chew. The mashed potatoes and string beans were sparse and unseasoned. The cheesecake on the outside looked sort of like plastic- indicating it had been sitting out for a while before being served. I left hungry and unsatisfied unfortunately.

2023-11-27,3.0,"Eh.  Certainly not the worst dinner I've had but when the Local stacks up against other New American fare in Charlottesville it doesn't quite hold up in comparison. 3/5

TLDR the food is fine but not the best I've had here. If you're looking for ~$20 per person entrees for a decent night out you'll find it, but better and similar fare can be found at other spots around town.

The service and the ambiance are both good, it's very cute inside and old wood and bricks. The building is historic and it's well curated with local art. Tables are far too close together we were basically sitting on top of the people behind us and that was uncomfortable. Dining room was way too cold in the winter -bring a jacket.

The start we had a cheese and fruit plate. The cheese was pretty boring IMO - Brie, smoked Gouda, and then two white cheeses probably a cheddar and Parmesan. Fruit was grapes and apples. Good, but again kind of just meh.

For entrees, we had two pasta dishes at our table and two meat entrees. I had the shrimp carbonara, my friend had the truffle mushroom linguine, my boyfriend had the meatloaf (recommended by our server) and my friends boyfriend had the steak. All of us felt very meh - there was no standout dish everything was kind of just meh.

My shrimp carbonara was okay, the pasta was the star. It was perfectly cooked and the pasta tasted handmade. The shrimp half was tail on half was tail off and it felt cooked unevenly - some pieces were cooked too long and super curled and rubbery, some pieces were juicier. The sauce was a letdown - for a carbonara, this was like eating cheese water. Thin and very little flavor. I did not finish it and didn't bother taking more home. Not the best pasta in Charlottesville. This was the second dish our server recommended.

My boyfriend had the first recommended dish by our server, the meatloaf. It was wrapped in bacon atop mashed potato's and green beans. He said the green beans were slightly undercooked without much flavor but the mashed potato's were good. Meatloaf was good but could've used more sauce.

My friends mushroom pasta smelled delicious - she had similar takeaways about her pasta that I did of mine. Good pasta, but lacking in some flavor and thin sauce. Good, but not great.

Her boyfriend ordered a medium steak and this was definitely a disappointment. Let's just be honest - this steak was rare. He said the sides were good but the steak being undercooked and under seasoned was a let down considering it was a pricier item.

Beer was good, selection is decent.

Dessert was good we had peanut butter brownie w ice cream and a pecan pie. Very average but still good.

Overall I didn't feel like anything really stood out to me except the prices - C&O, Orzo and the Ridley, even Mockingbird all kinda have similar fare to the Local with some minor variations but all do a better job than the local with everything except price. Everywhere else charges about $30+ per person so I was happy we paid a little less but would've been willing to pay more for better food.

Overall the local is good but not great - personally Charlottesville restaurant scene is so competitive I would probably look elsewhere in the future for New American fare.",249.0,The Local

We started with the Local Cheese Board.  It has Parmesan, Bleu, Brie, Swiss and Goat cheeses with apples and grapes.  Perfect with our wine.

With both did salads as entrees and I added the crab cake appetizer.  My wife wasn't crazy about here salad as the dressing had molasses in it.  I tried it and liked.  I enjoyed my house salad, they include pickled onions and cucumbers in it.  The crab cake was perfect.

2024-08-04,3.0,"One experience at the Local, and it looks like this:

Early reservations got us a table in a satellite space next to the main dining room, which looks like their wine cellar. Bare brick and wine bins were the vibe, with a server station tucked away in a corner. Tables were a little tight, which makes the place cacophonous when there's a large well-served six-top seated in the corner (ask me how we found out).

The menu was comfort-heavy from an entree standpoint (everyone ordered either steak frites or the braised short ribs, although there were three different gnocchi offerings). The apps were equally easy to choose from: we grabbed a cheese plate and the burrata caprese salad. The cheeses were fine, four large cubes of various white cheeses and a little round ball of chèvre. Plenty of grapes, cut apples, and box crackers made this a decent little appetizer value for four. The caprese offering was a great way to bring forth the current burrata trend by plating it on top of large sliced tomatoes over arugula, with a lace of a balsamic reduction all over the top.

The steak frites was passable, fries served on the side in a little bistro basket. The steak was played on top of a horseradish-artichoke bechamel  (I was so stoked for this, but alas, literally, weak sauce: thin, no sense of horseradish bite at all). To be fair: not sure if this is a case of incorrect expectation versus execution. It wasn't bad, just not sure what I got. The short rib was a nice long-braised short rib over a decent mashed potatoes: easy, accessible.

The wine list at the Local is simply lovely. We were seated right beside all of the several vintages of Stag's Leap: they are not playing around when it comes to wine. The by-the-glass list is simple, accessible, and affordable. 

All in all, the Local fit the bill for a family dinner out. It's comfortable food and wine that hits the table really quickly (we were in and out in less than an hour), and has something for everyone.",115.0,The Local

The rockfish was delicious but strangely served in a bowl which made it virtuously impossible to eat - cutting it became impossible and I had to ask for a plate.

The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned well, I'm a MD girl so the crab cakes were just ok to me. The desserts were yummy as well. Overall great service and great food.",140.0,Tavola
2018-07-31,5.0,"The Local is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlottesville. Relative to other restaurants in Charlottesville, I think the Local has the best pricing for awesome food. - all in all, a PERFECT semi-formal DATE SPOT. Even affordable for a college student trying to do something a bit more fancy for a night.

FOOD: fresh and sourced locally! Hence this place's name. I think they've truly perfected the flavors here. Of what I've tried, the pork chops are great as are the roasted cauliflower and their steak. Their berry cobbler dessert is delicious as well. The fact that I've been here 3 times and have enjoyed my dishes every single time gives this place a 100% in my books.

SERVICE: So kind and so knowledgeable! I forget my servers name but everyone around us commented how awesome he was and their desire to tip him well. - white guy with brown curly hair!

AMBIANCE: Cute, cozy, and also great outdoor seating if you so wish. Their back area has a cool painting of birds as well.

Honestly 10/10, if you need a consistently great, semi fancy date night place TAKE HIM/HER HERE.",15.0,Tavola

It is definitely consistently high quality food that always leaves me feeling full and happy. I've had everything from the trout and burgers to steak and short ribs and food is always hot, fresh, and very well seasoned and flavored. 

One of the best things about this place is that there is so much ample space! It's absolutely great for large, large parties and there a ton of starter platters that can be made to share. 

It's a bit pricey to be eating here regularly, and the semi-formal vibe makes it difficult to justify as an easy option for dinner. The location away from UVA grounds also makes it a slight inconvenience to get to if you don't have a car, but it's a great place to bring guests as a solid introduction to the Charlottesville food scene!",94.0,Tavola

I had a house salad which was unique with pickles onions and an Asian flair, and the salmon, which was baller. The big cous cous was delicious and the green beans were flavored well too.

The only reason I'm deducting a star is because our waitress acted super weird when the majority of us ordered pasta instead of entrees. She goes ""you guys and your pasta! The entrees are much better."" I guess she was trying to guilt us into ordering more expensive items off the menu? Very odd.",401.0,Tavola

I've been here two times, the first being on a date. We both ordered pasta and it didn't disappoint. The second time being here was my birthday. The fries that came with my father's steak were delicious (I began to poach them after my meal was finished) and I personally got the glazed pork chops, which came out succulent and delicious.

Each time I've gone, I've made a reservation on Open Table and was seated right away. I definitely recommend making a reservation if you're going from Friday to Sunday.

Atmosphere - I love the ambiance. The downstairs is sort of a classic wooden rustic bar area, and the upstairs is more of an open concept fancier restaurant with twinkle lights. If you have any family or friends visiting from out of town, this is a perfect place to take them for a nice, but casual night out with dinner and drinks.

Service - The service has always been super quick and the wait staff is extremely attentive, even when it's a busy Friday or weekend night.

Parking - There's not much parking in front, but there is a neighborhood on the parallel street over with ample amounts of street parking.

Most importantly, FOOD - I'm not a vegetarian, but I don't eat much meat. I LOVE their Truffled Mushroom Ragout. It's so creamy and rich without being too heavy. I usually get the double/larger portion so that I can take it home and have it for leftovers the next day for lunch!

The Local reminded us of many of the higher end places around town (Oakhardt, Duners, Orzo, etc), except the food was certainly a small step down from those place BUT the prices were also noticeably lower.  Cheaper 'date night' prices, pretty solid food, super close and convenient.... overall Local is worth trying out. 

We followed the waiter's recommendations and got the crispy shrimp and flash-fried sprouts as apps.  Shrimp were something you can find anywhere (i.e. bonefish) but the fried sprouts were pretty tasty.  For dinner I had the fried local chicken and she had the salmon.  Her fish was good, but the underlying rice was super goopy and tasted like it was cooked in a crockpot with canned cream'o mushroom soup. My chicken had some excellent flavor but the bulk of my meat portion was just fried chicken skin with minimal actual meat. We also had a side of Gus but with only 6 spears for $6... you'll want to skip those. Lastly, our server was friendly but kinda hard to understand b/c he worked&talked at the speed of light.

I have been twice and each time I've gotten with different people and we've all enjoyed the experience.

The staff is friendly, attentive, and they make great recommendations. We were unsure on which wine to split and our waiter spoke openly about which was what we were looking for without clearly encouraging us to only go for the most expensive bottles.

The top deck has great string lights which makes for a great atmosphere. Inside cleanliness and decor are top notch. They find a great mix of casual and formal. Wearing a dress or wearing jeans and a nice top both work for the atmosphere.

The food. That alone earns the five stars. The lobster Mac and cheese came highly recommended and when I say they don't skimp they definitely don't. I split a dinner portion with my friend and we still couldn't finish it all. It comes topped with cheese and such large chunks of lobster we found ourselves cutting it into smaller portions so we could enjoy more noodles. Another friend ordered the steak frites and the portion size was amazing. The best part about all our selections despite the large size the flavor was there. Our cocktails were delightful strong but not overwhelming. We ordered a banana split with there house made ice cream. It was delicious and definitely a shareable dessert.

We enjoyed the crab soup. It was a tomato based soup filled with plenty of crab. The Brussels and Cauliflower lightly seasoned and crispy, laid over a sirachi mayo sauce. Highly recommend them as an appetizer!

2020-03-02,4.0,"After looking into a few restaurants for my friend's birthday dinner in Charlottesville, we decided on The Local. When you walk in, you were welcomed into a restaurant with a cozy and calm ambience, complimented with a wooden floor and brick wall interior to create a ""homey feeling."" We were seated upstairs, which ended up being more spacious than we expected. For a Saturday night, this place was packed. It seemed to be a more family oriented restaurant based on the patrons this evening.

For the food, we decided to split the Fried Brussels and Cauliflower. Although the waitress recommended we get two, one plate was more than enough for the five of us. The cauliflower was cooked to perfection, but the brussels were not as tender as I expected. Also, there was flavor in this starter, I think there needed to be a counterpoint to it given it was just had a sharp tangy taste that lacked any sort of spice. 

Our entree orders: The Ceasar Salad was fairly standard, but the Goat Cheese salad was the perfect mix of ingredients created a sweet yet savory salad experience. Both had the right amount of dressing to not oversaturate the greens. Amazing pick. Another great option was the Gnocchi Bolognese. The gnocchi were melt in your mouth pillows saturated in a creamy meat sauce. The Truffle Mushroom Ragout was also drenched in creamy flavor, although it was a little bland (but to be expected based on the simple ingredients). The Veggie Burger, also fairly delicious, came with a whole appetizer size portion of burrata- it was incredible. The Duck Breast was incredibly succelent, and the only issue was that of the appetizier- the lack of tenderness in the brussel sprouts. 

As a tip, a couple of us just got the salads and a half portion of pasta thinking we might still be hungry, but honestly this amount was plenty and very cost effective.

All in all, you really get what you paid for here, as we all had some leftover food but were pretty stuffed towards the end of the meal. The waiters were attentive and helpful as well since we were new to the area/ restaurant and had a few questions while ordering. But, for the food, nothing really reinvented the wheel, but everything we got was solid so I have no complaints whatsoever.",122.0,Tavola

Our favorite has been the mushroom pasta (we ordered it twice!); it is a nice blend of savory, buttery goodness. The fried chicken was not too heavily breaded, and the grilled hamburger steak was just a tad bit too salty for me. The 2 dishes came with mashed potatoes and green beans.

The inside of the restaurant has a cozy atmosphere with warm lighting and exposed brick. I also love how the interior supports local artist's paintings and stain glass works.

We ordered Crispy Shrimp Appetizer, Sauvignon Blanc, Meatloaf, Gnocchi Bolognese, and House Made Blackberry Cobbler. The Crispy Shrimp was lightly fried, cooked well, and tasted great in the sauces. The seaweed salad that came with it also complimented the dish nicely.

The Gnocchi was perfectly cooked and had a nice bite to it. The sauce was hearty, and the overall dish was delicious. The Meatloaf was awesome. The bacon was a nice touch, and it was one of the best meatloafs I've ever had. The mashed potatoes and green beans were also cooked well. It's a great meat and potatoes dish. The entrees we ordered were 17 dollars each and I thought the portions and quality were great for the price.

For dessert, we tried the House Made Blackberry Cobbler. It was probably the most underwhelming order of the night; however, it wasn't bad. I would have liked a nicer crust on the top and bottom because I couldn't really find any crust. I also would have liked the blackberry filling to be thicker because the consistency was more on the liquid side with solid pieces of blackberry sitting inside. However, I thought the vanilla ice cream was good and it was freshly made which I liked.

Overall, I enjoyed my food and dining experience here. I love how The Local embodies their namesake as a locally owned business that sources ingredients from locally owned and operated farms, and even showcases local artists in their restaurant design.

Being from Florida, I wasn't quite sure about ordering all seafood at an inland location, but the restaurant really delivered a delicious meal. The shrimp is fried in a light batter and the salmon has a wonderful crust. Overcooked seafood can be so disappointing, but the salmon was cooked perfectly. The fish flaked while still having moisture, a perfect medium rare salmon, just the way I like it. Salmon is such a wonderful fish, but over cooking it just a bit can transform its flavor from being delicate to very fishy and strong. So kudos to the chef, because not only was my piece cooked perfectly, so was the second order I took home . The restaurant is cozy and has a lot of outdoor seating, mostly shaded. Definitely going to be a regular spot for me in the coming years. A good place to go when family comes to visit!

Our server Stella was great- I'm a server as well and could tell she was clearly working so hard but still made an effort to take time with us and was very kind! 

Our only somewhat critical comment was that we initially got seated in the wine barn next to the main restaurant but it was very cold due to the doors keeping opening, and it was clearly mostly meant for groups - there were 2 parties of 8+ sitting inches from our table - that the ambiance was awful. Their loud laughing and cheers-ing did not make for a date night ambiance like we were hoping for, and made us feel like intruders to the parties. Luckily, we asked our initial server if we could move to another table elsewhere and he was very accommodating and quickly moved us to a great table in the main restaurant area next to the bar. So no complaints there about our experience, but definitely recommend that the restaurant reconsider seating couples out there at all!",17.0,Tavola
2022-02-22,5.0,"Tucked away in Belmont, The Local hits every note in the culinary book. The restaurant, a former shoe repair shop, is effortlessly charming, complete with brick walls and a warm and inviting atmosphere. The bar is extensive, and the drinks list boasts several local beers on tap, as well as Charlottesville inspired cocktails. I got the Jefferson, which was a delicious combination of elderflower and hard cider. There are no bad choices on the menu: the food is sophisticated yet farm to table, and highlights many local goods. The menu options change seasonally, so there is always something new and delicious to try. The flavor combinations are inventive and completely unique from any over Charlottesville restaurant. I got the pork chop, which was incredibly moist and perfectly seasoned with a chili rub. It was accompanied by mashed potatoes and sweet potato shoestrings, which had a delightful texture and flavor. The portion sizes were just right, and I had just enough room to split a dessert. We chose the mango cheesecake, which was smooth, creamy, and light. It wasn't overly sweet, and was complemented by an absolutely delicious mango sauce. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of food.

We came here before the evening rush and ordered the Bison Hanger Steak (special) and Wasabi Pea-Nori Crusted Salmon. Both meals came out exceptionally quick (which was a plus) and were good -- I especially liked the steak -- but for the price I would have liked a bit more steak (I would guess in total the steak was around 10 ounces).  We finished the night off with the flourless chocolate cake which was good but I think we should have ordered something else (that's on us). 

Our server - Sydney - was lovely, very helpful and courteous, and very attentive. It was a good experience overall and maybe we had higher expectations than we should (The Local came recommended from multiple friends who spend a lot of time in Charlottesville).",186.0,Tavola

2022-03-08,5.0,"I'd heard about this place many times since coming to C'ville, and finally decided to check it out recently. The restaurant itself is beautiful, styled with local art available for purchase. The standout here to me was actually the service! The host and server were incredibly friendly and helpful, answering questions and accommodating special requests -- we ordered the cheese plate with breads separate for a gluten allergy and they made sure to do that and warn us about any contact allergens for other menu items. I really felt welcomed by them. 

The cocktails were also quite excellent. We ordered a few to try, but the Death in the Afternoon was a must-order (for lovers of Absinthe). The .38 Special was excellent as well.  

For appetizers we sampled a few, the fried brussels sprouts had to be the best. If you come here, make sure you order that. The cheese plate was really great as well, with a good selection of local cheeses. 

We ordered a variety of entrees as well, everything from the seafood pasta to the burger to the steak. Everything was tasty, the steak and salmon being especially well received. We ended the meal with a peanut butter brownie, which was rich and enough to share with all five of us after all the other ordering we did!

The one drawback with this restaurant is that it is pricey. It was a really fun place to go splurge for a special occasion -- birthday dinner for us -- but maybe not the spot for a general meal. Overall though, I had a great time here and it's on the list for my next special occasion!",452.0,Tavola

The Food:
*.38 Cocktail - I love whiskey and old fashioned's and this one certainly impressed. I'm not a fan of ginger (one of the ingredients), but whatever they did with this drink it certainly worked. Highly recommended.

*crispy shrimp - great and tasty appetizer. If you love Asian food and flavors, then you'll likely love this one. The seaweed salad was unexpectedly very tasty.

*pork belly - This was good and had plenty of flavor but I'd warn anyone who isn't a fan of meat with a fatty cut. There was a bit too much for my wife's liking but we still enjoyed it.

*Buffalo Creek Beef short ribs - Loved it and it's as good as everyone says it is. Tender, flavorful, and filling! If you are considering it, go ahead and order it. 

*Tenderloin - This was an item on the special menu that night and my wife enjoyed every bite. The portion size was also impressive and she was defeated by it.

Brussels/Cauliflower- oven roasted with a nice pepper aioli 

Fried Chicken- came with pimento cheese mac n cheese and I subbed the greens for green beans. The mac n cheese actually tasted like pimento. Very tasty. The chicken had a nice juicy inside with a good crunch outside.

Sat at the bar and had a bean dish topped with an egg and what I believe was a Cajun style sausage. It was delicious! It had some spices I couldn't quite identify but it was really good. I would put it in the comfort food category. The portion was not large (not small but I hadn't eaten all day) so I also ordered the side dish of carrots.

The carrots may have been the best I ever tried! They were grilled with some type of nut and a thin sauce that was delicious. Also very pretty multi colors of carrots. If you come here you have to try them.

Service was attentive and friendly- I was alone so I ate at the bar.

The only downside is that the wine was a little disappointing- I wish I would have went with beer as it appeared they had a much better selection.

They also have a very extensive selection of mixed drinks and spirits. I tried an old fashioned but I was also a little disappointed with that. The bartender noticed and didn't charge me. Even so, this is an expensive place if you drink, although I thought the food was reasonable for the area.

The Low Down:

Call ahead early for a reservation. The tables on the front right side are going to be close to the host or hostess. Try to sit closer towards the back or over to the left to avoid hearing their conversations with guests during your dinner.

The food: it's made with locally grown produce and is very fresh.

-Entrees were overdone and on the bland side
-Dessert was missing a component listed on the menu

Second, the food has become inconsistent, and service has slowed to the point that I've been served tepid food on several occasions.  I am no longer recommending this place, which makes me sad.",25.0,Tavola

Since moving here 3 years ago, my partner and I have spent 3 birthdays and 2 anniversary dinners with The Local family. We love the rustic feel of the building. The service is always wonderful. Servers, bartenders, and bus staff are incredibly friendly, always quick to lend a hand at the drop of a hat. The food is divine. The truffle pasta is a staple and always has my partner coming back for more. My favorite entree is the tenderloin which may just be the best steak in Charlottesville. When it's time for dessert, make sure you try the chocolate pecan pie. The Local is easily a top 5 restaurant in Charlottesville!",3.0,Tavola
2023-10-17,3.0,"We had my son's rehearsal dinner there Friday night.  I was disappointed  on several levels. The tables looked nice with the flowers and white tablecloths.  The drinks were great.  However, for the later party they forgot to put the crackers out with the cheeses and forgot to put out the desserts I ordered.  I didn't notice until late in the evening when I pointed out that failure to them.
  I was disappointed we weren't told that there were two other parties going on both sides of our room so the noise level and heat was high.  Plus, I've never attended or had an event where the point person we had been working with wasn't even there.  The beef was excellent but the trout was unappealing to look at and tasteless.

2023-11-27,3.0,"Eh.  Certainly not the worst dinner I've had but when the Local stacks up against other New American fare in Charlottesville it doesn't quite hold up in comparison. 3/5

TLDR the food is fine but not the best I've had here. If you're looking for ~$20 per person entrees for a decent night out you'll find it, but better and similar fare can be found at other spots around town.

The service and the ambiance are both good, it's very cute inside and old wood and bricks. The building is historic and it's well curated with local art. Tables are far too close together we were basically sitting on top of the people behind us and that was uncomfortable. Dining room was way too cold in the winter -bring a jacket.

The start we had a cheese and fruit plate. The cheese was pretty boring IMO - Brie, smoked Gouda, and then two white cheeses probably a cheddar and Parmesan. Fruit was grapes and apples. Good, but again kind of just meh.

For entrees, we had two pasta dishes at our table and two meat entrees. I had the shrimp carbonara, my friend had the truffle mushroom linguine, my boyfriend had the meatloaf (recommended by our server) and my friends boyfriend had the steak. All of us felt very meh - there was no standout dish everything was kind of just meh.

My shrimp carbonara was okay, the pasta was the star. It was perfectly cooked and the pasta tasted handmade. The shrimp half was tail on half was tail off and it felt cooked unevenly - some pieces were cooked too long and super curled and rubbery, some pieces were juicier. The sauce was a letdown - for a carbonara, this was like eating cheese water. Thin and very little flavor. I did not finish it and didn't bother taking more home. Not the best pasta in Charlottesville. This was the second dish our server recommended.

My boyfriend had the first recommended dish by our server, the meatloaf. It was wrapped in bacon atop mashed potato's and green beans. He said the green beans were slightly undercooked without much flavor but the mashed potato's were good. Meatloaf was good but could've used more sauce.

My friends mushroom pasta smelled delicious - she had similar takeaways about her pasta that I did of mine. Good pasta, but lacking in some flavor and thin sauce. Good, but not great.

Her boyfriend ordered a medium steak and this was definitely a disappointment. Let's just be honest - this steak was rare. He said the sides were good but the steak being undercooked and under seasoned was a let down considering it was a pricier item.

Beer was good, selection is decent.

Dessert was good we had peanut butter brownie w ice cream and a pecan pie. Very average but still good.

Overall I didn't feel like anything really stood out to me except the prices - C&O, Orzo and the Ridley, even Mockingbird all kinda have similar fare to the Local with some minor variations but all do a better job than the local with everything except price. Everywhere else charges about $30+ per person so I was happy we paid a little less but would've been willing to pay more for better food.

Overall the local is good but not great - personally Charlottesville restaurant scene is so competitive I would probably look elsewhere in the future for New American fare.",249.0,Tavola

The Local is small and has a cozy feel to it.  We had reservations and were seated right away.  We had a big lunch and were looking for something on the lighter/small side.  The menu gave us plenty of options.

We started with the Local Cheese Board.  It has Parmesan, Bleu, Brie, Swiss and Goat cheeses with apples and grapes.  Perfect with our wine.

With both did salads as entrees and I added the crab cake appetizer.  My wife wasn't crazy about here salad as the dressing had molasses in it.  I tried it and liked.  I enjoyed my house salad, they include pickled onions and cucumbers in it.  The crab cake was perfect.

I can't comment about their entrees, but the food we ate was very good.

2024-08-04,3.0,"One experience at the Local, and it looks like this:

Early reservations got us a table in a satellite space next to the main dining room, which looks like their wine cellar. Bare brick and wine bins were the vibe, with a server station tucked away in a corner. Tables were a little tight, which makes the place cacophonous when there's a large well-served six-top seated in the corner (ask me how we found out).

The menu was comfort-heavy from an entree standpoint (everyone ordered either steak frites or the braised short ribs, although there were three different gnocchi offerings). The apps were equally easy to choose from: we grabbed a cheese plate and the burrata caprese salad. The cheeses were fine, four large cubes of various white cheeses and a little round ball of chèvre. Plenty of grapes, cut apples, and box crackers made this a decent little appetizer value for four. The caprese offering was a great way to bring forth the current burrata trend by plating it on top of large sliced tomatoes over arugula, with a lace of a balsamic reduction all over the top.

The steak frites was passable, fries served on the side in a little bistro basket. The steak was played on top of a horseradish-artichoke bechamel  (I was so stoked for this, but alas, literally, weak sauce: thin, no sense of horseradish bite at all). To be fair: not sure if this is a case of incorrect expectation versus execution. It wasn't bad, just not sure what I got. The short rib was a nice long-braised short rib over a decent mashed potatoes: easy, accessible.

The wine list at the Local is simply lovely. We were seated right beside all of the several vintages of Stag's Leap: they are not playing around when it comes to wine. The by-the-glass list is simple, accessible, and affordable. 

All in all, the Local fit the bill for a family dinner out. It's comfortable food and wine that hits the table really quickly (we were in and out in less than an hour), and has something for everyone.",115.0,Tavola

The rockfish was delicious but strangely served in a bowl which made it virtuously impossible to eat - cutting it became impossible and I had to ask for a plate.  They brought me a tiny side plate which didn't improve matters much.  Everyone else enjoyed their entrees  - crab soup, buratta special, steak frites, meatloaf, and fried gnocchi with scallops.

We tried a couple cheeses and meats from the charcuterie menu, nothing out of the ordinary, but prices were good at $3/serving. For entrees, we went with the mushroom pizza and the porchetta sandwich. The pizza was ok - crust was a little too doughy for me, and I wish the pizza had more garlic and less cream. Mushrooms were good and had great texture. The sandwich was pretty good - the porchetta was tasty, but there was too much broccoli rabe which overpowered if you got the wrong bite. Also, wish the bread would've been thicker as the sandwich fell apart it was so messy. The bread though was also really good, cooked in the wood burning pizza oven.

I've also tried their Cavoletti di Bruxelles, which is shaved brussels sprouts with chives, fennel, roasted hazelnuts, maple garum vinaigrette, pecorino. I was a bit disappointed with this because I thought the brussels sprouts would be cooked and warm, but it wasn't.

My fiancee took me here on my birthday at 5pm on Saturday and we had to wait for over 50 minutes. We first waited in the hall and ordered a drink, and then we finally made it over to the ""waiting"" room in the back, where we ordered another drink. The wait wasn't so bad as the cocktails really sweetened the deal. I really liked the Lampo Smash, the Hot Toddy wasn't my favorite. 

When we finally ordered, we got the classic neapolitan pizza, special salad, and fried donuts to top it off. 

The special salad had bold flavors with nutty farro, mozzarella cheese, pumpkin seeds, and pomegranate seeds. An eclectic combination that works well.  

The pizza was cooked well, but the best part of the meal was the cinnamon fried donuts. It really reminded me of funnel cake. I gobbled up all of the donuts and left one for my fiancee when he got back from the rest room (at least I left one!).

I arrived at just before 7:30 PM on a Thursday evening, and the restaurant was very, very busy. I was seated immediately at the bar because I was dining solo and they happened to have that odd seat available, but if I had been in a group or even a couple, I would've had to wait. The restaurant is definitely very small and cramped, tables and bar seating included. Since I'm really petite, I would describe it as cozy, but I imagine anyone bigger than me might say it was uncomfortable. My end of the bar was also where the bartender set the drinks before the servers came around to take them out; I had a small space to set my wallet/pocketbook next to it. I was afraid it might be in the way, but no one said anything and all the staff seemed very adept at working in the small space.

I decided to order the pizza special of the day, which was a pizza with white anchovies and capers. It took a little while for the pizza to come out, but not unexpected given they were being made to order and the place was absolutely heaving. While I waited for my food, I had a very close view of the kitchen and was able to watch the kitchen staff very diligently stretch dough, sprinkle cheese on various orders, and load up their huge pizza oven. I felt like the huge pizza oven really added to the rustic and ""authentic"" atmosphere of the restaurant. It was also the star of the kitchen; everything from pizzas to meatball appetizers went in there.

I was so happy when my pizza came out, along with the ""scizzas"" to cut it up. The pizza was definitely one of my favorite things I ate during my time in Charlottesville. I've had pizzas in both Rome and small villages in Italy, and I would honestly say Lampo held its own even when compared to those. The anchovy and capers were super flavorful and the amazing dough complimented the toppings beautifully. I definitely inhaled my pizza because I didn't eat lunch in preparation for pigging out, but the portions are large enough that you could reasonably expect to take part of the pizza home with you, especially if you have appetizers to start.

For dessert, I was torn between the budino (chocolate pudding) and the zeppole (ricotta doughnuts). Normally, I think I would go for the zeppole because I'm a carb monster, and they looked very attractive when some of the tables around me ordered them. But I decided to go for the budino since it was more unique compared to my normal dessert options and I wanted to try something new. The pudding was delicious and the hazelnut brittle added a lovely texture. It was served with a layer of olive oil drizzled on top--I can't honestly say it added much to the flavor or texture of the dessert in my opinion, but I definitely wasn't against it.

The bartender was super friendly and quick to refill my water throughout the meal. At one point during the meal, one of the kitchen staff caught me making eyes at the pizza oven and seemed amused; he also asked how I liked my food after I'd finished my pizza. Everyone seemed very quick and efficient. For the quality of the food, I thought the prices were reasonable; this meal wound up being one of my pricier ones during my stay in Charlottesville, but I did get a lot of extras (dessert, a cappuccino), and I think if you came for just pizza, $16 for the size and quality of the pizza is really reasonable.

My experience might be helped by the fact that I didn't have to wait for a seat, but now that I've tasted the food, I think a 45-minute wait would've been worth it to me. I think that's something to be prepared for if you're coming here in the evenings, even during the week. When I left the restaurant around 8:30 PM, it was dark out, and couples were still putting their names down to be seated. The restaurant and its environs aren't much to look at from the outside, but the atmosphere is so warm and bustling on the inside. (If you don't like cramped seating or get claustrophobic easily, this might not be the place for you.)",527.0,Lampo
2020-01-04,5.0,"5 stars all around. The atmosphere was my favorite in Charlottesville so far. Very intimate environment with about 6 tables and a bar that seats around 8-10. The lighting is low and the mood is super chill. I was there with my daughter on a Tuesday night around 9 and they were busy but no wait. It has the feel of a neighborhood spot  and the food was rustic and delicious. 

We had the clam pizza and the shaved Brussel sprout salad. Both were made to perfection  and very filling. The pricing is perfect (pizzas 12-18 dollars and enough for two) and the experience was made complete with bread and a glass of wine! My favorite spot in C'ville to date!",48.0,Lampo
2020-01-11,5.0,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlottesville! Having been to Naples and eaten margarita pizza there, I have to say Lampo has excellent Neapolitan pizza. There is always a wait here and they do not take reservations, so come early! I do appreciate that they serve cocktails to the waiting customers, which really helps distract you from the wait. It is definitely worth the wait! The service is great. Even though they are busy you don't feel like they are rushing you to clear the table. 

They import their ingredients from Italy, which I'm sure adds to the authenticity of the food. Everything I've tried here has been amazing. The pizza does not come pre-cut, they provide you with scissors to cut yourself.",58.0,Lampo

We ordered the mushroom pizza, the margherita pizza, and the hell-boy. All were great-I really loved the mushroom one!! And also the margarita one!!

2020-03-27,4.0,"Overall Lampo is pretty good.

The menu is pretty limited but the pizza is good and the wines are decent.
Yeah they charge you for just ok bread and that's mildly irritating.
The olives are a pretty good app.

I've had 2 of the desserts and both are good, as is the cappuccino.

The place is nice inside but very small and crowded every night of the week. 
So expect to wait even on a Monday or Tuesday night.

The downside is that it's pretty expensive. When I'm there on business by myself I can easily spend $60-$70, which seems like a lot for basically pizza. 

Service is good and I can usually find a parking spot somewhere not too far away. 

Overall I recommend the place, especially when my company is footing the bill.",279.0,Lampo
2020-04-07,5.0,"Great place to eat and enjoy drinks. We have been to lampo on multiple occasions to enjoy the hype, a recommendation that was well worth it on our initial visit.

Everything that we have eaten here was tasty and fresh, well prepared and done perfectly. My personal favorite on the menu - The Hellboy pizza. I can not get enough and it seems to get better every time I order it. Hard to believe something so freaking good can get better!!! We seriously have almost eaten the entire menu, hard to find a dish that is not pleasing.

The staff at Lampo are pretty cool and on point, delivering nothing but stellar service. Warning, there can be a wait since this place is known for its quality (but it's well worth it). On the day that we initially visited we probably waited 15-20 minutes to get a table, which didn't seem long to us and we were lucky to get in that quickly (Dinner rush).  Once seated the food and drinks rolled out not soon after ordering.

The restaurant is pretty clean, cozy and compact on the inside with additional seating on the outside. Definitely worth multiple visits and check out their wood fired oven!! Thanks for all of the great experiences Lampo!!",120.0,Lampo
2020-07-20,5.0,"I don't think no less than three people, none of whom live in C'ville, told me that I had to get a pie at Lampo. I was told it may be the best pizza I'll ever had. I heard that before COVID-19, when people could dine inside, they serve your pizza and cut it with scissors. When I arrived in Charlottesville for my week-long getaway my friends started asking me if I've been to Lampo yet.

You can imagine the energy that was created towards Lampo at this point. The bar was raised even higher with some of the hurdles that came about before finally getting a pie. The odd Wednesday - Saturday hours meant I had to wait till halfway through the week to try it. After I ordered online I saw there was going to be a 90-minute wait til it would ready.

That's Chicago deep-dish level of preparation time here.

Don't worry, it was worth every single moment it to for me to get a pie.

It was indeed the freshest Neopolitan/Italian style pizza I've ever had.

I'm not a fan of red sauce on my pizza and seeing a pie that was more traditional with the little pieces of cheese spread out made me skeptical but I LOVED their robust tomato sauce. The little saucers of mozzarella were nothing less than amazing. While I would have like a larger portion of the meat-oriented toppings of my Diavola, they complemented what was a simple yet well-executed dish.

Honestly, I may have to make a return stay in Charlottesville just so I can go back to Lampo.",281.0,Lampo

We had a 2+ hour wait for our food and when we arrived at the time indicated our food would be ready, we were met with hostility and passive aggressiveness.

I got there about 30 mins after they opened and they were nearly packed already!  (So, get there early!)  The bartender was rather busy, not only handling service bar, but also the patrons at the bar.  He was friendly, but not very out going, possibly because he was just very busy.  They have an interesting menu loaded with unique pizzas and other dishes made on the stove or in the oven and everything is made to order.
I tried their bread first and it was really good and piping hot, as it just came out of the oven.  Next, I opted for their escarole and it was nicely sautéed with garlic, rather tasty.  I then opted for their meatball pizza and had them provide a side of Calabrian pepper oil for me to drizzle on my slices.  It was pretty good.  Dough was nice, a little rubbery, but nice overall.

The Margherita DOC is everything I want and more. The fungi is also a solid choice and I also peruse the specials menu for a fun change of pace. I love Lampo's crust because it's thin and yet so chewy. I sneak the crust with charred bits for extra flavor. Pro tip: save the leftover meatball sauce and dip the crust in it.

It took about an hour for us to get the pizza and there really wasn't that many people eating in. But man was the pizza delicious. Fresh dough flavorful toppings.

The brussels sprouts are a can't miss. The dressing is delicious and zesty, and the hazelnuts are the perfect complement. And of course, you can't go wrong simply dumping a pile of freshly grated parmesan on anything. The main event of course is the pizza. We tried two: the Margherita D.O.C. and the Prosciutto. The difference between the classic and the D.O.C. is in the cheese, the classic is the house mozzarella and the D.O.C. is imported straight from Italy. I am sure both are amazing, but the D.O.C. did have an unbeatable creamy and buttery texture that was perfect on the pizza. The Prosciutto was an incredible bite. The meyer lemon perfectly complemented the arugula and other ingredients. The staff brought over fresh parm and red pepper flakes as well, and that added a great kick.

And if you go here, do NOT miss the ricotta donuts. They are perfectly soft inside, with a delicious crunch. They're also served with meyer lemon, and that squeeze cuts through the richness to create a perfect bite. I swear, everything I ate here was better than the last.

The ambience is mainly provided by the IX Park, where the restaurant is located, which can keep your mind occupied with all the arts exposures, creative museums and etc. I am not sure to call the ambiance of the park completely 'underground' however it does resemble 'young' and 'adolescent'.",9.0,Lampo

The place is tiny so there was a wait but it didn't take long to be seated. I sat at the bar, so I had a view of the pizza oven. The music seemed to only be in the kitchen and was a strange choice for the vibe of the restaurant but the place is tiny and charming.

2023-11-04,5.0,"Found this place as a must see on tik tok. Doesn't seem like a great part of town, but it's worth it. Doors open at 5pm. Line was already building at 4:45pm. We chose to sit inside. It's quaint and intimate. The pizzas are all wood fired. Rather small menu, but a diverse menu. We did pizzas and salads. DOC pizza is made of the most rich, and hearty ingredients. The pizzas are delivered as they come out of the oven. Sometimes different times than your other table mates. The service was great. Very trendy spot. The pizza scissors are GENIUS!!!",30.0,Lampo

And the sandwiches are packed and delicious so be sure to try those as well. One of the few places I could eat in my early pregnancy that I could hold down. Because everything was so clean and well balanced. I always enjoy lampo at the Ix or at their main location. The ambiance and service is fantastic as well as then entire crew is well knowledgeable in food and beverage. The wine list is not to be snoozed on. They have a lovely selection. If you want a place for a Romantic date this place is busy without being too loud and has the right lighting! Great thing about the pizza is you don't feel like you over ate!",3.0,Lampo
2023-12-21,5.0,"Absolutely incredible and a must-go-to establishment! We visited this intimate and charming restaurant as it was one of the few places open late with a full menu and drinks. 
When we arrived we were greeted and seated quickly right inside the door. The space is small yet vibrant and cozy and we immediately felt at home despite being from out of town. The pizza selection - all Neapolitan style, perfectly sized for yourself or sharing if you're generous - was delightful. A flavor profile and taste for every palette, with local and exotic farm-sourced ingredients. 
After ordering beautifully made cocktails (again with the most considerate ingredients and combinations), our pizzas arrived. While I don't recall the name of mine it was the ""spicy"" one, with a beautiful simple red sauce that was perfect, complete with amazing dollops of cheese and a beautiful chili oil to round out the flavor and texture. 
I love leftovers and I try to eat mindfully most of the time but all of that was out the window here because the pizza was THAT GOOD. I couldn't stop and ate the entire thing with pride. Perfectly flavored crust was cooked to perfection with salty blisters on the edge. The center was paper thin yet cooked and held the simple sauce and cheese perfectly, making you cradle it just so as you prepared for a bite. Slicing the pizza with the fun pizza scissors they give you was also a blast and something I've never done before!

We were in Charlottesville for 4 days and every day I wanted to go back here and sadly we were unable. I still think about this pizza often and crave it - that's how perfect it was! If it wasn't a 7 hr drive away, I'd be here every week. 
Do yourself a favor and stop in for a beautiful meal that is a cut above the rest. Cannot recommend highly enough!",71.0,Lampo
2023-12-31,5.0,"I was told this is the best pizza in Charlottesville, and it didn't disappoint.  Started off with the meatballs for an appetizer. It was above average but not very memorable. We decided to split a pizza and a sandwich.  The muffaletta had good quality meats and cheeses. The flavors were on point, but the bread was a pita like style, and I don't think it helped the sandwich. The real star of the night is the pizza. The 5 start review is for the pizza. It was great! We had the standard margarita with scissors to cut it. The crust had the correct amount of char and was cooked to give it a nice chew. The quality of the ingredients was clearly on display.  Great sauce with bright tomato mixing with the creamy cheese. Just enough basil to add a little extra on those bites. It was very bright and left me wanting to order another for later. The place is small and seems to be a team effort for service. It was busy, and I think the service suffered a bit. They took our plates after the meatballs and stated she would return with clean ones, but that didn't happen. After dropping off the pizza and sandwhich, they didn't check in to ask about the food or even refill drinks. Maybe it was just an off night?",70.0,Lampo

I was lucky enough to live in Italy and fell in love with true thing Christ pizza that still has a chew to the crust.  Lampos more than met my expectations for what pizza should be - delicious texture on the crust, flavorful ingredients.  We enjoyed a nice bottle of red to accompany the meal.  I opted for the prosciutto pizza (mainly bc I love arugula on a pizza).  It was everything I was looking for and more - the lemon added a nice brightness to the taste.  We arrived at 5:30 and didn't have to wait as we snagged the last open table.  After that there was a wait but they serve drinks next door while you're waiting. The pizza was ready maybe 10 minutes after we ordered so you don't have to worry about waiting long once you're seated.  I want to go back and check out the fungi pizza next.

2024-03-01,5.0,"Ordered on Grubhub and I paid dearly but IT WAS WORTH IT!!!! I got the mushroom pizza, chop salad and the ricotta donuts. The pizza was amazing because I love mushrooms and the crust had the perfect pull and char.  That chop salad was equally delicious with absolutely no complaints.  I thought that I didn't have enough salad dressing, but it was the perfect amount actually.  

The donuts are a MUST try.  They look funny, but looks are deceiving.  I can't remember how many came with the order because I basically inhaled them.  They were a little crunchy on the outside with the cinnamon and sugar while super soft on the inside!  Delicious!  I don't want regular donuts anymore.  I want some more!.

We were visiting Charlottesville for the weekend and heard from multiple friends that we needed to check out this cozy little pizza spot - it absolutely didn't disappoint. The staff are very friendly (our waitress gave us some great recommendations for other spots to eat and explore), and the vibe is warm and inviting. 

Food-wise, we started with a small meat & cheese board (loved their homemade bread on that!) and the meatballs in pomodoro sauce (super flavorful and juicy), then we split the DOC Margherita pizza, which was absolutely perfect (chewy crust, deep flavor, extremely fresh, and fun to cut with pizza scissors). We ended with the chocolate pudding, which was surprisingly elevated and unique - the pudding was rich and had a sweet cream mixed in to tone it down a bit, then it was topped with hazelnuts and crunchy caramelized sugar... incredible.

2024-06-20,3.0,"I have waited several days to write this review to see if my disappointment has tempered and dissipated somewhat.  It has; I have decided to go from two stars to three.  

Our first taste of Lampo was when it opened ten years ago.  It was wonderful.  Lampo rivaled anything you could find in Brooklyn, LA or New York City that was modestly priced and of good quality.  The pizzas were superb.  The food was obviously prepared by individuals who loved their craft.  

Our recent experience in June of this year was the first one since the pandemic.  Not the same.  Ingredients still good by and large but the love is missing.  I should add that the staff was never really top notch.  Outside of Brooklyn, LA and the City you don't often find professional servers and that's the case at Lampo.  However, the food more than made up for it.  

I've seen this happen often.   Young, talented people initially motivated to bring quality to the dining experience soon flag after about seven  years because restaurant work is tough.  I know.  My family started our first pizzeria in 1951.  One of my first memories was going with my mother to Brooklyn to buy a Blodgett pizza oven.  (Wood-fired ovens were still in future in this country.)

On a positive note, I hope and think they can recover.  Take my advice: Don't let the crowds of ""thirty somethings"" fool you; they still go to Taco Bell.  Set your own standards, put your nose to the grind stone and make this your life.  There can be no compromise with good food and devotion to hard work.",3.0,Lampo

2024-08-11,3.0,"I had passed Lampo dozens of times heading in and out of C'ville and was eager to go.  And finally we did.   First the vibe inside is great - a lot of energy and just fun.   Second - we ordered the white mushroom pizza off the menu and it was very good - not great (could have used more toppings).  Unfortunately the third element was the porchetta sandwich- made with pizza dough, with very tasteful and well prepared broccoli rabe - but devoid of the namesake roasted pork!   Now it was a bit dark inside, so I could not see perfectly but the sandwich was essentially rabe and cheese - well flavored but some porchetta would have been a nice touch.  There probably were trace amounts..... but why just not rename the sandwich ""broccoli rabe with cheese"" and I would have ordered the meatballs 

Maybe stick to the pizza",14.0,Lampo

2024-08-29,3.0,"I will start by saying I really like Lampo. We try to hike up in Raphine once a year and we always stop at Lampo on our way back home to Chesapeake  - it has become a little tradition. 
We went yesterday and I was a bit disappointed.  
I'll start with service. Waitress was a bit cold.  Not very friendly. I usually don't care about that.  I go for the food and servers can have bad days. But when the food is off AND the service... then I mention it in the review. 
Now on to the food. 
The Margherita pizza is my favorite but this time had barely any cheese on it. I feel like I paid 19 dollars for sauce and bread. When I mentioned how the cheese was lacking, the waitress said "" I can bring you some grated cheese"". Not really what I was hoping for, but I said ok. 
To add insult to injury ... the bill came and I was charged 2 dollars for the grated cheese.  On top of the 19 dollar  ""sauce bread"". Really Lampo? Who does that??!! 
You serve pizza. Cheese comes with pizza!!! 
Not cool. 
The olives are also one of my favorite dishes. Ordered that too - no complaints there. The ginger beer was very refreshing. 
But the ending was the kicker. We asked for TWO separate checks. We were a party of three. Waitress told us it couldn't be done. But told us we could figure out who owed what and could use two separate cards for one bill. ( how is that any easier?) So now we had to pull out a calculator and itemize all our charges including the taxes and service charges and the added tip. 
I think after this experience we will be looking for a new ""after hike meal"" to add to our tradition.",15.0,Lampo

While I arrived around opening, getting in was not a speedy process, and indeed it was a half hour past opening before I finally had a pizza (that spends ninety seconds in the oven), which matters because I was hungry from my hike.

However, an excellent shredded kale appetizer sated my hunger, and the quality was there. A DOC margherita, with imported buffalo mozzarella, was only a small increase in price from the basic one, and buffalo mozzarella is hard to find. The crust had a fine note of char, and was easily cut with their fancy pizza scissors.

This menu included a few other intriguing options and they do offer pizzas without cheese for those in need, but I was not disappointed that I picked the standard by which Neapolitan pizzas are judged, and you'd go a long way before you find another such pizza at this level of quality.",4152.0,Lampo
