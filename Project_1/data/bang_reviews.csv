LanChi N.,05/12/14,1,1,1,4,"My review is strictly for drinks....

Came last night just for drinks because a friend and I just had dinner. Bang! Has such an extensive cocktail/mixed drink selection. I saw prickly pear mojito and decide why not.this of course was after careful debate and endless consulting with our bartender. She told me it was sweeter then a typical mojito...well I've had horrible mojitos if it's sweeter maybe it won't taste crappy like the other ones I've had else where. Yay! Our bartender was the bomb...she made a mojito that didn't over muddle my mint and it tasted awesome love the prickly pear :o)  my friend got her usual the sin city and I stole a sip it was a sweet martini almost juice like not bad though pretty smooth. 

Of course I wanted dessert..... so why not have a dessert martini. So I got the dreamsicle....the menu said it would take me back to my childhood. Hmmm...very vanilla...where's the orange?? They did use real orange juice so perhaps that's why the flavor was there but was overshadowed by vanilla. My friend likes it and she dislikes dreamsicles a something about artificial orange that bothers her. But since this was more vanilla she didn't mind it too much. 


Overall Bang! Is great for mixed drinks and martinis.Pricey but hey your getting a good quality drink.",482,288
Michelle W.,12/05/17,,,1,3,"In short: we left $50 poorer, a little tipsy, but still hungry.  While Bang has a lot of fun and unique flavors (and a great drink menu!) its portions are tiny and overpriced.

I came with two friends on a Thursday evening at 6:30PM.  To our surprised, we were seated immediately, but Bang is known for having long waits during peak times.  When we left around 7:30PM, there were definitely many parties that were waiting.

As tapas goes, we got 7 things to share and two drinks each.  I'll rank below the dishes we got from my favorite to lease favorite.  

Kale tortellini (4) - A ricotta, cheese, and kale mixture wrapped in a wonton wrapper. Very tasty, but didn't care much for the wonton wrapper -- tasted kind of slimy

Pork spring rolls (6) - spring rolls wrapped in a rice paper I think? and fried so the outside was crispy and bubbly.  I thought this was very unique and haven't seen anything like it before! Perfectly seasoned, which is rare for spring rolls sometimes.  Didn't care much for the sauce it came with.  

Chicken cilantro wraps - These were pretty savory and a good balance of salty and slightly sweet, with a lot of sweet onions and peppers. I think it was all white meat, but would've probably been more flavorful with dark meat.  A full wedge of iceberg lettuce came on the side, which was very fresh and crisp.  I actually liked it more than the butter lettuce that I've usually had lettuce wraps with/

Coconut rice - Slightly sticky, sweet, and creamy, and good to pair with the other dishes.  However, we got a double portion and it was SO tiny! Like smaller than a side of rice you would get from a Chinese restaurant...yet this portion was $6...

60 second steak (6) - Very meaty and smoky, but not for everyone if you don't like your meat raw/very rare. The mushrooms it came with were meaty and flavorful too and helped amp up the small portion.  The cilantro sauce it came with too was refreshing and herbacious, but very, very light and hard to taste unless you drenched the meat in the sauce.  Two very disappointing things about this dish though: the plate was cold and I would've preferred this dish served room temp or warm.  Also the portion was TINY.  We each got literally two bites fo steak and it was $11.

Brie nachos (4) - The brie had a surprisingly meaty flavor which I enjoyed, but kind of a predictable dish overall.  Unfortunately, like the steak, this dish came out cold-- by that point the previously melted brie had solidified and was not melty anymore.  I would have preferred this dish if it came out warm so that the brie was still melty.

Goat cheese dumplings (4) - I was most excited for this one and most disappointed :( These were basically like pierogis except the filling was strangely sour (not like in a tangy goat cheese kind of way).  Portion was big though.

Drinks - Everyone was most pleased with their drinks.  We tried Sin City, Lemon Drop, Lychee, Diva, Prickly Pear -- all were good options.

Service was very friendly (although kind of annoyed that our waitress kept on pushing and pushing us to buy drinks) and pretty fast too.  Overall food was fine, but I probably won't return because the portions were so small and execution was very mediocre.",219,768
Erin B.,18/05/17,,,1,4,"Wow, this place is amazing! The food is so unique and absolutely wonderful. The drink list is extensive and were so yummy! My date and I had the spicy shrimp and goat cheese stuffed dumplings and they were great! Especially the dumpling. I wanted to try everything on the menu though because it all looked so good. We also tried many different drinks. I had the key lime martini, caramel apple and the espresso martini and wow wow wow. All so amazing! My date had the Mr.Big, Sin City, and Captain and enjoyed them all as well. The only con I can think of was that they were extremely low on staff but the staff that was working were doing an amazing and attentive job. 
This may be my new favorite place in Charlottesville.",22,2
Aarti B.,26/01/18,,,2,5,"Finally, a great vegetarian tapas restaurant! I came here for my birthday   and was wowwed by the uniqueness and quality of food. I ordered 6 dishes and recommend the sweet potato gnocchi, goat cheese dumplings, shredded brussel sprouts salad, and cauliflower dumplings. I wasn't a big fan of the kale ravioli or the chickpea spring rolls. 

My favorite was hands down the sweet potato gnocchi (I'm craving it just thinking about it!) I'm not a fan of gnocchi as it's often hard or too mushy, but the gnocchi was the best I've ever had. The gnocchi was so soft that it literally melted in my mouth. I love the savory sweet potato curry sauce. 

I really enjoyed the goat cheese dumplings, they are bursting with flavor and a generous portion size. 

I devoured the shredded brussel sprouts salad. Seems like a simplex dish, but has complex flavors. 

The cauliflower dumplings were perfectly fried with a nice crispy coating. I  like how they weren't doused in sauce. 

I didn't quite care for the kale ravioli. Sounds like an interesting cool concept, but very bland. The ravioli was stuffed with a kale paste, I couldn't taste any cheese or any other flavors. 

The chickpea spring rolls was another miss. It had a nice curry filling, but I didn't understand why the chick peas were served a side instead of in the roll. I'm not a fan of fried chickpeas, I like them in their natural state. 

The tapas portion sizes are quite large and filling, about 2-3 plates per person. Since I ordered 6, I brought home leftovers. As there are several options for vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free, and meat lovers, Bang! is a crowd pleaser. 

Overall, I had a hearty meal that put me in a delightful food coma. It's definitely worth the trip from DC.",1315,907
Alexa G.,19/07/18,1,,4,5,"What an experience! I am BLOWN AWAY by the food at this restaurant! I came for restaurant week and shared a total of 9 tapas with my friends. Every single dish was delicious and filled with rich, mouthwatering flavors! I did not think I would enjoy this restaurant this much but it is honestly so good. Our favorites were the pork steam buns, haricot vert fries (green bean fries), the goat cheese dumplings, and Korean beef empanada.

BUT the best and most life changing item was their PISTACHIO BLONDIE with coffee ice cream! It was so good that we had to order another one. The texture was so soft and smooth and the tastes all blended perfectly. Bang makes the ice cream and caramel sauce themselves and you can tell how much quality they put into this dessert. The waitress said that it's the staff favorite but customers always get the Asian doughnuts.... I'm telling you now do NOT sleep on the pistachio blondie!",19,546
Melissa Z.,19/10/18,,,,5,"This is one of my favorite, more expensive restaurants to eat at in cville. The first time I've been the service was awful, but since then, I've had superb service every time. Our waitress even took off your drinks from the tab because we had to wait so long! There's a great Asian fusion tapas menu with food that would be suitable for anyone. If you like goat cheese, the goat cheese dumplings are a must and the firecracker shrimp are always a crowd pleaser. I'd recommend around 2 tapas per person. However, the best thing on the menu in my opinion is the Sin City cocktail - it's a blackberry martini with just the right amount of tang and sweetness and no alcohol taste.",303,493
Thuy H.,10/11/18,,,1,5,"This place exceeded my expectations and I'm so happy with my dining experience. I always have reservations about tapas restaurants because the plates are not filling but this place got rid of all those reservations. The only con is the price- you have to go all out or not go at all. Plan to spend at least $100 with tax and tip for two people. If you don't ball out, you probably will not have a great experience.

Here are some of the items we tried:
-Sin City Martini: This blackberry and pomegranate mix is awesome. You can't really taste the alcohol but the drink is strong. It's tangy yet sweet. Definitely recommend this martini!
-Goat Cheese Dumplings: Calling all cheese lovers. These dumplings will blow you away. They're so incredibly cheesy and crispy.
-Sweet Potato Gnocchi: Gnocchi on a whole new level. The texture is chewy yet tender. The sweetness of the sweet potatoes adds a nice flavor element.
-Crab Pot Stickers: The ginger cream ties together this dish so well. The crab was soft and savory while the wrapper was delightfully crunchy. The shiitake mushrooms topping was amazing.
-House Smoked Salmon: I don't usually like smoked salmon but it's done so well here. The salmon had a smokey flavor that's indescribable.
-Sixty Second 7 Hills Sirloin: MY FAVE. The steak was so tender and well seasoned. It was slightly charred and topped with chimichurri sauce. The fingerling potatoes were the perfect side.
-Firecracker shrimp: This dish was good, although, very basic. It's just fried tempura shrimp with a spicy mayo sauce on top. Definitely something I could make at home. In my opinion, it shouldn't be one of the most expensive item on the menu.
-Pork Belly Bun: Fatty pork belly on steamed bun? Yes, please.
-Lamb Ravioli: The ravioli was really good- filled with a lot of lamb. The sauce was insanely delicious. It had a curry flavor which gave it a nice kick.

Overall, this place is worth checking out. If you're on a budget, avoid this place because the experience will not be there. We definitely had a bang! of a time.",222,186
Angel H.,23/01/19,1,,1,4,"Decided to come here for restaurant week and was not disappointed! The key lime pie martini was amazing; the graham cracker crumbs on the rim provided the perfect touch. Tapas were delicious- 3 tapas will make you very full. The goat cheese dumplings are the best- creamy on the inside but with chewy, crispy wraps. The tuna wasabi flatbread was pretty good, too. The dressing had the perfect amount of wasabi in it, but the pita flatbread could be warmer. The duck potstickers were fantastic- highly recommend that and the goat cheese dumplings. For dessert, we got the pistachio blonde with caramel ice cream. The first few bites were heavenly but it was too rich for me to be able to enjoy the entire dish. 

Service was not bad for how busy restaurant week is. It took a while for the host to seat us, but the bartender was very nice and attentive. Overall, I'm glad I decided to give this place a try!",510,454
Amanda P.,10/03/19,2,,1,4,"I really enjoyed our experience here. I would recommend going here with a big group so that you can share everything. The dishes come out as they are made so it may be a little uncomfortable if you aren't sharing. Our group ordered upwords of 12 dishes so we had a great spread.

The Great:
Brussel Sprouts- I could have eaten the whole thing by myself. The sauce coated the whole sprout and we liked the combination of sauces.
Mahi- my personal favorite. Cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. It is a small portion so if you are wanting more than a bite I wouldn't split it between more than 2 people.
Kale Ceasar- nice texture and flavor
BBQ Tacos- mmm. Very tasty and the meat had a nice BBQ sauce
Goat Cheese Dumplings- filled up with a good amount of cheese and they mixed spice in there that made the cheese pop

The Good:
Beef Empanadas- good amount of filling inside it
Firecracker Shrimp- I don't like shrimp so I can't comment but the group liked it. Spicy!!
Chicken Shwarma- cooked really well

The Wouldn't Order Again:
Duck Pot Stickers- were okay, couldn't taste much flavor, only thing that wasn't cooked that well. A few were burned.
Chickpea Spring Rolls- everyone in our group said this was our least favorite dish. We didn't really get any flavor. It was basically mashed up chickpeas without seasoning fried
Drunken Noodles- I would just rather go get some at a Thai place that specializes in that. Others liked it.

The martinis are delicious. I always love a good key lime pie martini. It was pie in a glass! Overall, I love going here with friends and a variety of food.",396,82
Carrie S.,30/03/19,1,,1,5,"I haven't been here too many times but whenever I do, I remember why I love it so much. It's adventurous, unique and delicious.",116,160
Morolake T.,31/03/19,1,,2,4,"A great tapas style place for groups. Ordered several different dishes including the empanada, noodles, general tso's cauliflower, pork tacos, the mahi and the firecracker shrimp. My favorites were the pan seared mahi and the firecracker shrimp. the mahi was cooked to perfection--very moist and flavorful. The shrimp was just a great combo of various sauces. My friends were not a big fan of the Mongolian beef noodles, but I enjoyed them! 

They have some outdoor seating, but I highly recommend making a reservation because they were all reserved when we got there around 6, with an hour or so wait for availability.

The atmosphere inside is nothing to rave about, but outside seating looked like a good vibe.

Drink wise, the southern brew was delicious --kind of mix between a whiskey ginger and an old fashioned.",147,302
Renee B.,13/04/19,,,,5,"Bang! You nailed a diverse vegan/vegetarian cuisine that's unusual enough and delicious enough that I couldn't make it at home. The lychee cocktail is AMAZING! Seriously one of my favorite all time drinks. The variety of food is also so fun, Kung pow cauliflower, kale tortellini, Brussels, all highly recommended! If you are or have a vegetarian friend, wow them here! There are meat options as well to satisfy all palates.",105,10
Vita W.,15/04/19,1,,1,5,"Easily one of my favorite restaurants in Charlottesville. Small plates, Asian fusion, lots of vegetarian options. 2-3 dishes per person is enough and I would suggest going in a bigger group to try more plates, although it's a great date spot as well. They don't take reservations for less than 6 people. The cocktail menu is extensive and on point- the Rosie and da bomb basil are my go tos if you're into gin. Goat cheese dumplings are a MUST.  I always go back to the drunken noodles and kale ceasar, but you honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I've never had less than stellar service. Last time Chelsea manually split our tab for 14 people. If you're in cville this is the restaurant for dinner.",65,15
Ilonachka N.,15/05/19,2,,1,4,"I came here with a group of 10 for dinner and had a chance to try a bunch of different things.

We enjoyed everything minus the fries since the sauce was way too sweet. It's tapas sized so going with a big group is probably best.

Recommended!",398,989
Danielle A.,18/05/19,,,1,4,"This is a very chill, great tapas restaurant in Charlottesville. The portion sizes are just right for sharing and the food did not disappoint. The servers were all very attentive and the atmosphere is very laid back. Indoor and outdoor seating available.",104,143
Harrison L.,31/05/19,1,,,5,"Cheap $7 martinis on Wednesdays! That's really all you need to know. 

The food is pretty good too. Everything is small plates so good to go with a group and order a bunch of food. You tick off what you want with a pencil on an ordering card and then they bring you the food as it's ready. The front and back patios are awesome for summer!

Definitely get Da Bomb Basil martini - it is so refreshing (and has a generous alcohol pour)!",296,226
Allison M.,15/07/19,2,1,5,4,"Came here for restaurant week and feasted! We each got to choose three dishes and we ordered:
-All three of their buns which counted as one tapas: pork belly, shrimp, and king oyster mushroom
-Short rib ravioli
-Lamb dumplings
-Viet pork shoulder
-Drunken eggplant noodles
-Tuna/mango poke bowl

All of it was solid. Definitely got that asian fusion vibe. Honestly my favorite was the king oyster mushroom steamed bun. The bun itself is soft and has got a nice texture that goes well with any of the fillings. But the oyster mushroom was absolutely delicious (if you like mushrooms) and was paired perfectly with their miso mayo sauce. Other things I really liked were the coconut rice in the poke bowl, and the pork shoulder. We left feeling very full! Food came out fast too. They have lots of martinis if that's what you're into!",400,498
Owen B.,19/07/19,5,1,7,5,Made our first trip to Bang for restaurant week and were really impressed.  A huge variety of unique options on the menu and nearly everything we had was great. The most impressive / crave-worthy were certainly the kale tortellini and roasted mushrooms.   I also really liked the smoked salmon on fresh naan. Atmosphere was great (we loved the outdoor seating) and the service was friendly and helpful. And lotsa great cocktails. We will definitely be coming back!!!,379,215
Cristina W.,04/09/19,,,1,3,"It's hard to pinpoint the type of cuisine found at Bang!... there are definitely Asian flavors in there, but they're fusion-ed up with some touches of - dare-I-say - French cuisine and latin flair!  

Came on a Wednesday and was so pleasantly surprised to find out that it was Specials Night!  $6 Tapas and $7 Martinis - what a steal!  We ordered a nice variety - the korean empanadas, the shrimp shumai, the beef noodles, the kale cesar, and the Thai meatballs.  My favorites were definitely the beef noodles and the kale cesar salad, with the meatballs coming in close.  Flavors were fun and interesting!  My one piece of beef (pun slightly intended) with the dishes is that they were a little on the oily/saucy side.  This might just be me, but even though I loved the noodles, I felt like they were dripping with oil.  The salad was bomb, but had a little too much dressing on it for my taste.  The shumai - which are not reaaallly shumai - were slippery and hard to hold their shape.

Please, do not get me wrong - I will most likely be coming back to Bang!  the flavors were on point and unique!  Nonetheless this was my takeaway from my experience.  Also, the service was absolutely incredible!  Our server was attentive and very kind, and continuously making sure that we were well taken care of.  

Beverage wise, I opted for the Joe, which was delightful.  I would also like to point out that they have an incredible Vegetarian/Vegan menu - loads of options if you have dietary restrictions, which is a refreshing change!",313,245
Loren M.,18/09/19,2,,2,5,"This restaurant is in a former house, it's very cozy and has close seating.It's not a traditional table with your setting it all places, some places you just sit on a pillow on the floor and others are a bench and random chair.There is outside seating on the front porch.

They have amazing drinks, probably the best Martinis in town.
There really isn't an option to order a full meal, the whole concept is that you get multiple small plates that you share with others. So if you're not a share you may not want to go with other people.
All of the small plates are quite delicious and paired well with complementary flavors. I've been here at least twice, and I've not been disappointed by any of the plates or drinks I've gotten. Giving us such a small location, if there are big parties of people it can get pretty loud, which makes it difficult to have a nice intimate dinner.",73,4
Heather V.,26/09/19,1,,1,5,"Such a cool place! Had a fantastic meal here you should order the fried cauliflower, I could have skipped the rice and ordered something else. But I enjoyed the steak a lot and the empanada (?). It was delicious and should have ordered 2 of them.",164,422
Mugdha A.,21/10/19,2,,3,5,"My husband discovered this place based on yelp reviews and hands down it's the best food we have had in Charlottesville.
Their drinks won us over. The key lime pie martini tasted just like key lime pie. My husband got the lychee martini and although strong, it's delicious. 
The food at this place wowed us! We are vegetarian and they have PLENTY of veggie friendly options. We got Brussels sprouts, kale tortellini, Kung pao cauliflower, goat cheese dumplings and the drunken noodles. Every single thing was perfect!! My husband and I still can't decide what we liked best since everything was absolutely delicious!! 
We live in Richmond and I will drive an hour to come eat here!! 
Absolutely amazing place.",63,7
Ana D.,01/11/19,2,,2,5,"Don't be thrown off by the decor or smell. 
The food is delicious. 
The restaurant is very spacious so you likely won't have to wait. 
Three of us came here and got 6 savory dishes and 2 desserts. For dessert we had the mango pie and the three chocolates, while they were good, I may not get them again. 
I would however get every single savory dish again. 
All the sauces and seasoning were really, really good. 
We had the pork taco, the beef empanada, shrimp, coconut gnocchi, Brussel sprouts, and I'm forgetting one. 
The ordering system is also very easy. 
Service was good.",280,235
Kelsie P.,04/11/19,1,,,5,"My friend and I found ourselves here on a Wednesday night and to our surprise, they had a special menu with $6 plates. We totally over-ordered and had about 10 plates between the 2 of us. Everything was spectacular and delicious. We ended our feast with the choco tacos with pistachio ice cream. Yum!",41,3
Lyndsay W.,18/11/19,,,,5,"I like the ambiance here--it's in a refurbished house. Because it's off the downtown mall, it's hard to immediately tell that it's a restaurant. I liked all of our tapas, however we probably should have ordered less. The portion sizes are big--a good problem to have. As everyone says, the cocktails are delicious. The key lime pie one legitimately tastes like key lime pie.",195,135
J B.,21/12/19,,,,4,"Saw the great pictures and had to try it! 
Highlights:
Very friendly service 
Seated immediately 
Great atmosphere 
Everything we had was very good:

Mango mojito
Korean beef empanada (a little soggy)
Firecracker shrimp
Brussel sprouts (excellent)
Edamame 

We would definitely come back.",163,
Ryan K.,01/02/20,,,1,4,"Decent food served in what appears to be a former living space. The table where we were seated had a couch on one side with the rest of the table surrounded by ottomans. It was a sub-optimal seating environment for those who require back support, but it does not break the dining experience in my opinion. I visited Bang! during restaurant week with a fairly large group, so I was able to try most of their menu. I probably had about 15 or so different dishes, so my dining experience was decidedly a blur. Unfortunately, I cannot say that any of the dishes stood out as particularly tasty. Nothing I had was particularly bad. Everything was just fine. Bang! does not seem to have the best value for its food, but it would not be a terrible choice for tapas in Charlottesville.",674,21
Lisa M.,16/02/20,1,1,1,5,"My table ordered 
Sweet potato gnocchi 
All of the steamed buns
Goat cheese dumplings 
Pork ribs
Wasabi slaw
Grilled broc
Gen Tao's cauli
Pork ribs


Ridiculously amazing. All of it. Go here. You won't be sorry. 

Thank you Chariya for the amazing Espresso martini!

We also had ..

Bangonade
Da bomb Basil drinks. Delish

Yes.",19,1
Tiffany L.,29/04/20,1,,2,3,"I thought that the food here was great! The martini list is also extensive and creative. They do fusion well but the pricing feels exorbitant given that the shared plate portion sizes range from small to minuscule and that the space itself feels more ""dive bar"" than ""upscale."" Throw in the fact that parking is annoying (though I believe the private parking lot across the street from them is free on the weekend) - that brings this place down to a 3 star rating.",1365,139
Jane M.,23/05/20,,,1,4,"I would definitely be willing to try this place again post pandemic. It was overall good, but not great. For the price, I would definitely expect the food to be fresher. 

The best items were definitely the goat cheese dumpling and the beef empanada. They were both delicious, though not entirely fresh. 

The buns were a little more disappointing. They were small, even for bao. The real problem was that the chicken was clearly not fresh. It was chewy and tough like it had sat out for a while, and was room temp. The beef was better tasting but also not warm. 

The drink was very strong and had good flavor. It looked smaller in the cup it comes in, but was just right for two cups. 
 
We ordered onsite and did take away. The food was ready surprisingly fast, but after trying it, I think that is because some of it was already sitting out.",138,11
Sean S.,20/09/20,,,,2,"Food all tasted the same. Pork tacos, dumpling, etc. Very blah. Service left much to be desired. Many other restaurants doing a better job out there. Don't waste your time. 

We all got eaten alive by mosquitos while trying to eat dinner. You'd think they would spray something out there to help with that. Hard pass this spot until things get back to normal.",8,3
Caitlin C.,30/09/20,,,2,5,"COVID: you're given a clean basket with napkins, forks, and knives and are assigned a table. Tables are ACTUALLY 6 feet apart and the tented area was nice. Usually when I sit outside there's a lot of bugs but I didn't have this issue. Food is given in little boats with small paper plates so no dishes are used. 
FOOD: For a long time I've heard about bang and have wanted to go and I'm SO glad I finally did. The food was all incredible and flavorful. My favorite was the coconut rice...I'm not a huge coconut fan but it was subtle and so delicious. I can't recommend just one thing because I truly loved everything I ordered but I was most impressed with the coconut rice. 
The only annoying thing was that I had to pay for a water bottle but I understand it's part of their COVID policy. I'll definitely be coming back soon!",157,26
Emma S.,04/10/20,,,1,5,"Easy takeout spot, with delicious Asian-inspired tapas! You must try the firecracker shrimp if you go here!",23,273
Ben W.,11/10/20,,2,,1,"This used to be a favorite of ours. They have completely fallen apart. They have not handled COVID well at all. Drinks come in little plastic bottles to be drank out of plastic cups. The menu / ordering system is so confusing that the wait staff has no idea what you have ordered. They drop it off in fast food paper plates and call out what it is over their shoulder as they walk away. The service is terrible now. 

Bang is definitely a No Go these days. Save your money and go somewhere that knows what they are doing.",18,
Matthew H.,14/10/20,,,,4,"FOOD: 
- pretty good asian inspired tapas
- recommend: pork belly bun, beef dumplings
- I would get pickles next time too to cut through the fried food-feeling
- ALL the sauces are the same... Why??? Kinda lame

DRINKS:
- sin city cocktail is delicious! Sweet with a bit of the alc still coming through.

PRICE:
- IMO overpriced $$$ (like all tapas tbh)
- buns are $4 and puny, only go for the pork belly one tbh cause that one is justifiable

This seems like more of a ~experience~ place you go with a lot of people. Food is nothing special but still good.

Edit: went to cookout after. Lol",65,2
Alison W.,11/01/21,4,,2,4,"In-person dining at Bang at this time is very conscious of social distancing and covid restrictions which I very much appreciate, although it results in lackluster service and takes away from the presentation and atmosphere. Given the current circumstances though I can't hold that against them. We tried a whole variety of menu items, as follows:

Would order again: genera tso's cauliflower, fried brussels, Kale Caesar

Enjoyed but didn't love: goat cheese dumplings, fried chicken buns, pork belly buns, edamame

Would pass: drunken noodles

The vegetarian items were the star of the show. As with most other tapas, I found Bang to be slightly overpriced for what you get. And due to covid we had to pay for water bottles which seemed a little stingy. I'd love to come back and try more menu items and cocktails once indoor dining gets back to normal.",174,251
Destiny L.,13/04/21,,,2,5,"This is an awesome spot within walking distance to my apartment! Beautiful downtown location in what seems to be a remodeled historical home! Very quaint! 

Upon entering the area we were greeted with a sign at the front which explained dining instructions, takeout instructions, as well as opening hours! (Pictured)

We of course opted to sit outside on their front porch to look at all the beautiful plants and spring scenery! We were seated, and greeted by a sweet server who told us about the menu and how to work it!

I came into this knowing we would order several small plates to share so here we go!

Caesar Kale Salad- this was very crunchy, fresh, and cool on a warmer day! It was beautifully plated and seasoned nicely. It was a little on the sweeter side for my liking but I enjoyed it anyways! (Love a good starter salad)

Drunken Noodles- These also had a wonderful flavor and were mixed with yummy veggies and mushrooms and a hint of spice amidst the sweet sauce!

House Pickles- I love pickles! Almost everywhere I go if it's on the menu, I'll try them! These are the sweeter type, not dill, tad bit of a spice, and very crunchy and delicious!

Chicken Buns- These are the BEST!!! The buns were so soft and doughy and the chicken was deliciously moist with a wonderful spicy Mayo! I could have eaten about three of those in addition to the other things we ordered! What can I say? I love chicken and this his all the spots for me!!!

Braised Short-Rib Dumplings- These were to die for and they certainly didn't hold back on the meat for all you meat lovers! They were literally packed with the tenderest rib meat with just the right spices! The miso mayo was a favorite and complimented the dish very well!

Crab Pot Stickers- Came out beautiful as did the rest! The post sticker had a nice crispy shell that wasn't greasy at all. The filling was a nice blended filling with a delicates crab and seafood taste (according to my husband, I'm not the seafood lover). They looked awesome and as was everything, BEAUTIFUL!

Water was brought out complimentary and we ordered two sprites which were served in cans with glasses of ice. I noticed they had many drinks, sake, beer, so I wanted to try out something non-alcoholic (daiquiri, special soda, mock tail) because I no longer drink, but unfortunately the basic sodas and water were my options. This will not hold me back from visiting in the future! We would like to return for dessert, and some other offerings!",79,205
Gabrielle H.,15/04/21,1,,,4,"Enjoyed the meal sitting out on the back patio. Friendly service. Our favorite was the goat cheese empanadas and brussels. Wish the broccolini didn't have so much sauce on it. Otherwise, fantastic meal! Would come back again.",42,6

Priscilla O.,21/05/21,,,,2,"The hybrid QR code paired with live waitress concept didn't work very well. Our waitress was pleasant but we hardly interacted with her after she explained that we could either fill out an order form on the table or order online via the QR code. She mentioned there were a lot of daily specials online but couldn't remember what they were because there were so many. We got the impression that the restaurant preferred us to order online rather than engaging the waitress. 20 minutes later the waitress dropped by to ask if we were ready to order something. Which we had already, 20 minutes ago via the QR code. The picnic table in the backyard that was assigned to us butted up against the plantings and we ended up trampling half of them getting into our seats. This also stirred up the mosquitoes, which bit us savagely. As is the case with fusion food, all three dishes we ordered were uniformly sweet.",251,155
Lily H.,23/05/21,,,,2,"Food was served before drinks 
Food delivered to the wrong table

Food was average but the edename was rock hard",19,6
Erin R.,30/05/21,,,,4,"I'm a big fan of Bang! We came for dinner on a Friday night and were able to snag a table outside.  We ordered a lot.

*Pork BBQ Taco: A fun crispy shell and a generous heaping of savory shredded pork. I am not usually a bbq taco fan, but I liked this one because it wasn't an overpowering bbq flavor

*Short Rib Dumplings: These were excellent!! Savory, good amount of meat, dumpling wasn't overly thick

*Korean Beef Empanada: Pretty good. the Meat wasn't evenly distributed but still flavorful

*General Tsos Cauliflower: I don't know why but I wasn't expecting breaded and fried, but it was and the flavor profile was spot on

*Crab pot stickers: Probably my least favorite. The crab flavor is just over powering so it was a little one note

*Goat cheese dumplings: YUM. lightly fried goat cheese works.

*Tuna poke bowl: Really good. Would be better if the tuna was raw, it didn't need to be seared

Our server was super nice and the food came out quickly.",1001,313
Haiku 4 U.,31/05/21,,2,,5,"Today I met an angel. His name is Luke and he told me to sit at the table to the left and then he told me what to order. Honestly, I'm pretty sure if Luke told me to jump off a bridge I'd step right up because I'd trust that he's directing me to epiphany.

Real talk. You need to come here. Order anything on the menu because it's all so delicious it will make you feel disgusting later and I mean that in the best way.

So ultimately...

Come and taste heaven
General tso's cauliflower
Goat cheese dumplings too",41,2
Justin N.,23/06/21,,,,4,"Came here on a date. It was a nice sunny day and we were seated in the back patio. The restaurant is cute and the outdoor seating is nice. We ordered the Brussels, Ginger Pear & Avocado Salad, Pork Belly Steamed Buns, and Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs. The Brussels were delicious but I felt like the other dishes were average.

The Flash Fried Brussels tasted amazing. They were perfectly fried, and the sauce and seasoning on the Brussel sprouts were tasty. I would definitely order this dish again.

The Ginger Pear & Avocado Salad had a great flavor profile. The sweet pear, salad greens, and dressing were really nice; however, the dish would have been perfect if the avocado were fresher (dark spots can be seen in the picture). For a restaurant like Bang!, I would expect the ingredients to be fresher and held to a higher standard. Especially the vegetables considering it leans more vegetarian in its options.

The Pork Belly Steamed Buns were good but not amazing. We enjoyed the dish; however, coming from DC, I've tasted better and more delectable pork belly buns.

The Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs were average. There are definitely better ribs in Charlottesville for much less. That's not to say that the ribs tasted bad because they tasted good, but for the price they did not meet my expectations.

Overall, Bang! is a a good spot for date night. The restaurant and outdoor seating is cute and perfect for a nice summer day. I would highly recommend the Flash Fried Brussels if you find yourself here.",372,109
Ariel G.,10/07/21,,,,4,"I had come here once before and came back with my boyfriend because of my raving review the first time. Unfortunately, the food didn't measure up this time around, although the goat cheese dumplings were truly a delight (and likely the most popular item). 

Before ordering, we were told that the tapas (as the name suggests) are fairly small, except for the drunken noodles and the tuna poke bowl, so we should order 2-3 per person. We opted to order 6 in total (ended up being 5 because one of the items ordered was forgotten by the restaurant, and we chose to cancel it). Wow was that a mistake. The portions for many of the ones we ordered were huge! All except maybe the goat cheese dumplings, which we absolutely liked the most.

We ordered:
1. Sweet potato gnocchi
2. Goat cheese dumplings
3. Fried brussel sprouts
4. Kale caesar
5. Tuna poke bowl
(We cancelled the thai carrot and mango salad.) 

The best: goat cheese dumplings, followed by the sweet potato gnocchi. So rich and yummy.

If you're a drinker, the whiskey sour is a MUST to order. It may be the best whiskey sour I ever had. My boyfriend got it, and I immediately regretted my rosé wine choice. They can definitely be dangerous if you get more than 1!

The rest: nothing to write home about. The brussel sprouts were drenched in the cream. I tried to pour some of it out onto another plate, and it was just leaking sauce. My boyfriend liked the kale caesar, but it was nothing special to me. The tuna poke bowl? Seared tuna--not what you'd expect for poke IMO. 

We weren't in any rush, but be prepared to wait a little bit for your food, as they appeared to be understaffed but very busy. We thought we would have to wait for a table outside at first, given a sign indicating a 30-min wait when we arrived. However, there was plenty of outdoor seating in the back. We sat at a huge picnic table--just the two of us. The downside? The picnic table was crawling with little ants, so we had to use a spare paper menu to get rid of them throughout the meal. Nothing says romantic like insects.",142,23
Emily C.,20/07/21,,,1,3,Came here on high recs but food and service fell short. Service was attentive at first and then like a ghost. Took me at least 15 min to order a second drink. Food is underwhelming and mostly fried.,31,2
Aubrey W.,21/07/21,1,,,5,"I've been to Bang! a few times, and each time I enjoy the food even more (if that's possible). We ordered 6 dishes: goat cheese dumplings, sweet potato gnocchi, red pepper and feta rangoon, duck and chicken steamed buns, chicken empanadas, and miso donuts with sorbet. The duck steamed buns and sweet potato gnocchi were my personal favorites. The sauce on the gnocchi has the perfect balance of savory and sweet, and the gnocchi itself was super tender and flavorful. The duck paired amazingly with the pickled red onions, resulting in a perfect bite! My dates favorite dish was the goat cheese dumplings, which were also heavenly. However all of the dishes we ordered were delicious. There were two of us, and although I was stuffed we managed to finish all 6! The only downside was that the service was very slow: we had to wait over 15 minutes for our bill. However, all the food arrived relatively quickly and the meal was phenomenal!",168,27

Lindsey S.,29/08/21,,,,2,"Dude, seriously. I want to love this place but it was terrible. Everything is cobbled together of canned chicken, pre-made items, and lots and lots of oil. The noodles were stiff and undercooked in the drunken noodles, the empanada dough was also raw. The bao buns appeared to be made of canned biscuit dough. I'm not saying they were, but the quality was very low. It took a span of over an hour to receive our plates and everything was underwhelming except for the cocktail. Disappointed because I usually love Charlottesville eateries.",116,6
Michael C.,31/10/21,,,1,2,"We went here on a Saturday hoping for a good meal. It had been years since our last visit that was amazing. This was not the sam. We were seat promptly with out reservations, but for here were many seat open. Our server was just ""there"". no personality. Never smiled. Barely said a word To us between drinks and food. Drinks were extremely strong and well worth the cost, despite the small size. $10-12

We ordered rice balls. Very very soggy/greasy/oily. Fell apart when we touched them so had difficulty despite being efficient with chop sticks. The rice had very little seasoning and the sauce had less taste than lite mayo.. $9-11?

Drunken noodles...come on.
It was oily and very spicy. We only tasted heat and oil. No idea what plus were used. $12-14 not sure.
You want good drunken noodle.... Try Lime Leaf!

The deep fried shrimp. So damn small and greasy again. We tasted the same flavors/oil in each meal. It was mainly breading and teeny tiny shrimp. The bed of vegetables with it were great!   $16.00 or
So.",30,2
Emily K.,13/11/21,1,,1,4,"An incredible place for good food and good cocktails. No reservations so when we came in through the entrance at South street west and 2nd streets SW we stood and waited there in the cramped front entryway and no one assisted us for at least 5 minutes. It wasn't until we asked one of the servers if we could be seated that they sat us at one of the empty tables. The drinks were delicious, 100% recommend General Tso's Cauliflower it is crispy and sweet and the cauliflower is soft on the inside. Both drinks were phenomenal (and stronggg might I add)! Overall a great experience, I'd go back again, hopefully there'll be a new system for walk ins though!",214,212

Phil D.,25/11/21,,,,2,"To the chef, go hide. The team supporting you is simply horrible.

Hostess-think her name was Jennifer, was rude and wasted our time. We arrived and placed our name on the list. 10 minutes later she said it would be 15 min. The we were waiting and she came and said it would be  be 30 minutes and to go across the street and have a drink, since the bar was full. She said go to the southern across the street for a drink, we did and after our drinks were served 5 minutes later - she texted and said our table was ready. Really? This is not brain surgery.

The service gets worse. The older mature man who attended to us ""the waiter"" never even gave us his name and treated us like we were in a car in line at McDonald's. His lack of support and attention to detail really made the 1st time experience at Bang - average.  He was not interested, didn't listen and had no enthusiasm for the waitlisted culinary experience. When we asked him what suggestions, he rattled off the three most expensive items. Really?

To the chef: of the 12 items we ordered the kale tortellini, pork taco, chicken bun were the best. Your food rocks. Maybe consider opening a food truck and be done with the noise of an average restaurant. You're better that this.

If the service was better we would have ordered drinks, wine, and more food.",345,1
Krista R.,01/12/21,1,,,5,This place is by far my favorite place in Cville. I love that it's tapas and you can get a little of everything. I love that the menu some what changes a few items here or there. The drinks here are amazing. The food is good portions to share. They hosted my bday get together with 10 of my friends and I. Everyone had a great time. The service was on point as always. The pack patio during summer is perfect with friends. Drinks are strong. This is my go to place when friends come into town. Hands down recommend 10/10,247,352
Lauren N.,02/01/22,,,,2,Lots of mayo and deep fried. Pork belly baos were not done right. I honestly didn't like anything except the drinks.,73,399
Shelly C.,11/01/22,2,,,5,Great service and yummy Asian fusion food. We'll be back. My drink order was too strong. I forget the name but it was a ginger vodka combo. I sent it back and they modified - still too strong for my taste. Kids enjoyed the food and there was something for everyone.,34,1
Joe D.,16/01/22,4,1,3,5,"Bang! Leaves me practically speechless every time I go. The food is consistently amazing even when toying with the different menu options. 

The way Bang! operates is not a usual dining experience you may be used to. When your dish or your neighbors dish is ready, it comes to the table. There is no waiting to eat until everyone has their plate. This also encourages folks to get beyond just one dish since they are indeed small plates. It is a fun style. 

To start the meal, I had the curried hummus with sourdough naan. Unfortunately, I did not capture a picture of this. That speaks to the quality of the dish. Every bite was scrumptious from the warm naan to the hummus with a kick. It is a great starter and shareable between two folks I would estimate. 

For my ""main course"" I ordered the Korean Beef Empanada and Chicken Bun. Both of these were excellent. My personal favorite is the empanada which I will order every time regardless of what else I get. The beef quite literally melts in your mouth. The chicken bun is also very good and should not be overlooked! For $4 it is perfectly fine to get a handful of these as your whole meal. 

My friend also let me sample his tempura sweet potato. From my small portion, I was a fan. It was fried well but not to the point where you lose out on the sweet potato. 

For dessert I got the coconut chocolate mousse. Oh boy I'm glad I did. While it was slightly difficult to break apart with the Graham cracker crust/base, each bite was divine. It was essentially coconut chocolate mousse on top of a baked Graham cracker crust. So good! 

My friends also let me try the miso doughtnuts. These were good but my clear front runner is the coconut mouse . 

Finally, in terms of drinks, I had the Sin City and Esoresso Martini. Both of these were good but I really enjoyed the espresso. It tasted like a sweet coffee drink from a coffee shop and really does well to mask the alcohol in it. 

Bang! Is a great spot for all - dates to family night out I recommend you stop by.",156,125
Lily H.,10/02/22,,,,5,"Best meal I've had in Charlottesville! I had 5 of the Wednesday night specials (perfect for 3 people) and each was incredible.

Cat R.,20/02/22,2,1,1,5,"Full disclosure - Bang! is my favorite restaurant in Charlottesville. Often tapas are an excuse for a restaurant to charge you more for less food but that's not the case at Bang! Their plates are medium sized and 2-3 dishes are plenty for one person. Cocktails are also delicious and, even though they're unstaffed, the servers are extremely attentive and friendly. We had Lauren as a server and she was WONDERFUL! Really enjoyed our experience. Come to Bang! and tip the wonderful staff well.",5,

Melissa Z.,23/04/22,2,,6,4,"3.5 stars. Rounding up bc so few decent places in Charlottesville with vegetarian and vegan options.

The ambiance is so blah. Are there no interior design students to come in on the cheap and through some decor around? Because of the barren space, It isnt nice enough for a date spot.

Here are the plant based items I ordered, from best to worst:

Black Pepper Tofu. I was afraid to order this worrying f that there would be too push black pepper but it wasn't. The sauce was medium spice and the black pepper flavor was mild. You get a great amount of tofu and broccoli. This really could be an entree if you added a side of rice. This dish is why I boosted to 4 stars.

Drunken Noodles. delicious sauce and tender noodles made this one of the best drunken Noodles dish I've ordered. Other places sometimes use a boring brown sauce but Bang uses a slightly more complex sauce. 

Mushroom Bao Bun. I thought all bao buns were the same until i tried this one. This was much more dense than the airy buns I've eaten at other places. The mushrooms were shitake and had an excellent flavor that was let down by the uninspired slaw on top.

Flash Fried Brussels. Don't get the mayo bc this isnt lightly fried - its deep fried so very greasy and the mayo adds no flavor. If you ask for it vegan you'll get a different sauce.

I would come back bc of so few vegan friendly dining options in C'ville.",682,296
Nancy H.,30/04/22,1,,1,4,"Came here for a girls' night downtown for a round of Asian Fusion tapas! For four people, we ordered 8 plates (forgot to take pic of drunken noodles) and felt decently full after. 

My ranking of the plates from enjoyed the most to least:

-Korean boneless short ribs: meat was so tender and the sauce was delicious. I wished I could have ordered this whole plate for myself. The crispy noodles didn't add much to the dish in my opinion though 

-drunken oyster mushroom noodles: don't test like traditional Thai drunken noodles but still pretty yummy! I would get this again the next time I come 

-general tso's cauliflower: nice crunch and fried beautifully. I appreciated how hot the cauliflower were, it seemed like they were taken out right after they got fried and the sauce was very tasty 

- curried potato and cauliflower dumplings: reminds me of samosas; good seasoning in the filling and crunch

- black pepper tofu and broccoli: I really enjoyed the sauce that the plate came with; however, felt like the tofu could has been more crispy as it felt a bit soggy 

-mushroom steamed bun: honestly i was looking forward to these buns but they didn't give me as much flavor as i would have liked. The presentation of the buns is appealing though. 

-sweet potato gnocchi: this plate is definitely heavier than the other plates we ordered. I didn't enjoy it as much as the other plates we ordered 

-goat cheese dumplings: my friends enjoyed this dish but i felt like the cheese was too heavy for my personally especially with the fried dumpling wrapper",201,33
Christina X.,22/05/22,,,2,4,"Wow this was surprisingly a very delicious meal! Only minor complaint is that food can come out at odd intervals and since this place is popular the staff can be a bit rushed and scattered with all the work they need to do.

My husband and I went hiking with another married couple and came here for dinner afterwards (on Saturday night). We luckily were able to get seated right away despite the place being packed. 

This place is so great for sharing! The four of us ordered:

- fried chicken & pork belly buns: 7/10 (pork was so tender!)
- sweet potato gnocchi: 8/10 very pillowy texture that grows on you as you eat it
- Korean short rib: 9/10 super tender and flavorful
- firecracker shrimp: 7/10 yummy but not that memorable 
- chicken spring roll: 10/10 everyone's favorite dish! The chicken was so juicy. We reordered because it was so good
- pear & avocado salad: 8/10 very refreshing and great to balance out a lot of the heavier dishes we got

I think we may have gotten a few more dishes but those were the most memorable ones. My overall impression was that although some of the fusion concepts can seem kind of odd at first, everything ended up tasting really good! Perfect place to go if you enjoy sharing a bunch of little dishes. Will be back if I'm ever in Charlottesville again.",223,557
Diane G.,12/06/22,,,,5,"We enjoyed dinner here and will definitely come back. Loved the vegan options, so many to choose from.

They have a bunch more vegan options on menu we had trouble deciding what to get. Also got tofu bun and naan. The carrots were incredible! So much flavor. Also recommend the tempura artichokes.

Beth K.,13/06/22,,,,5,Excellent food and excellent service!! Morgan was our waiter and she was very efficient and friendly. She let us know how many dishes they recommend ordering since it's tapas style. Decent prices as well.

The BBQ empanada was surprisingly very good and crispy and perfect to share with two people. 
The brussel sprouts were some of the best ones I've had and the goat cheese dumplings are always a must with the cilantro sauce. 
We both did not enjoy our buns, the tofu bun was flavorless and the Korean beef one was so wet with sauce and kind of spicy.",70,6

Stephanie H.,01/07/22,,,2,5,"We went to Bang for dinner last night based on a recommendation from our local friend. She and her husband love it and said Bang had great specials on Wednesday's, which they did!

I got the Not Your Mothers Mule, a mango mule with habanero syrup. The mango goes great with the kick. I'd say it's about a 6/10 on the heat scale. Not crazy spicy, but has a good kick. I'm not a very spicy person so if I could drink this so can you!

My boyfriend got the Calm Before (The Storm) - old fashioned with earl grey and walnut bitters. I loved the earl grey flavor! But it is a bit on the sweeter side for an old fashioned.

The food is tapas style, so we got a lot of food and we're completely stuffed by the end of the night. And I have no regrets other than I didn't have any room to get any cold Sake. Sad.

My favorites were the Shrimp Dumplings and Kale Tortellini. The tortellini were delicious! It was like a drunken noodle tortellini and the sambal brown butter sauce was the perfect pairing and gives it a tiny kick. The shrimp dumplings were a fried crispy dumpling, and I felt like it closer resembled to a taco/empanada than dumpling but they were AMAZING! I wanted to eat like 20 more. The spicy garlic mayo with the dark brown sweet drizzle was so good, even the cabbage slaw on the side was bomb! Definitely try these dumplings, they're to die for!

We also got the Thai Meatballs (my boyfriends favorite), Feta & Red Pepper Rangoons, & Pistachio Roasted Beets. Everything was delicious! 

We also obviously had to try the House Pickles. They had a slightly Asian flavor, probably from a bit of sesame oil and maybe rice wine vinegar.",118,673

Chat C.,27/07/22,1,,3,5,"Let me just start out by saying this is one of the best fusion tapas places I've ever been to! 

The waitress was nice to let the kitchen know that I worked night shift at 7pm (wearing my scrubs didn't give it away, did it?) and was able to queue me up as fast as able so I can enjoy this restaurant week to the end!  

Started off with a banger: Korean beef empanada with a miso Mayo on the side. Delicious! Enough said 

I forgot what this was but it was chill noodles, maybe the chilled Kung Pao veggie noodles. Refreshing and I was scarfing the down. Nice umami kick to a light tasting dish

Red pepper and feta rangoons were good! The cilantro sauce was a little too thin, otherwise very good 

Ginger pork dumplings in chili oil was great but slippery with chop sticks lol. Too spicy for my fiancée but perfectly spiced for me. 

The most anticipated dish for us was the flash fried Brussels with miso Mayo and sweet soy. It def tasted good, but maybe it was speedily made because it wasn't crisp, but instead it was soggy on the outside. Had it better the first time. 

Ginger crême brûlée IS THE BOMB FINISHER. Top 3 crême brûlée for me. 

Bottom line: None of these dishes came out in any particular order, so it was a nice surprise whenever each one came out. What makes this place special is that you can share your plates with those you sit with, so our table of 2 had 6 dishes to try out and it was the perfect number. We have had a table of 4, maybe close to 20 dishes and we were filled to the brim, but was completely worth it. Be prepared to have flavorful moutfeelz",166,333

I settled on two dishes- cauliflower and beets. My husband, over a thousand miles away, virtually rolled his eyes when I told him what I'd ordered. Well, he missed out. The cauliflower was incredible! Full of flavor, crisp, and a delicious dip that I could have sipped on its own, this is a must...even if you aren't a huge cauliflower fan, you will love this! I ordered the ginger creme brûlée to go and it was divine. So, stalk this place until it opens and go, whether you're alone or with other, you won't be disappointed.",171,7

Stephanie C.,29/12/22,,,,2,"Disgustingly Greasy!

The food made me and my girlfriend nauseous after eating it. I still have a stomache ache and residual headache the next day. Basically made me feel as bad as a hangover without a drop of alcohol. I should have listened to the other yelp review that complained about Bang! putting greasy mayo on already greasy food. Perhaps we would have enjoyed it more if we ordered the salad, but hardly seems like our fault when over 2/3 of the menu was deep fried. The curried chickpea spring rolls were the only redeeming dish. I got the beef bbq enpanadas but didn't think it was as good as the yelp reviews made it out to be. The tempura sweet potatoes and firecracker cauliflower really pushed us over the edge. I couldn't eat another bite of grease. 

Go get tapas from Mas Tapas instead. Way better, less greasy, and similar prices.

If you want asian food, there's lots of other options like Doma, Silk Thai, Cafe 88...",213,108

Sharvani M.,06/01/23,3,,2,4,"If I could give Bang a little more than 4 stars, I would. I've been here twice - the first time was many years ago and I remember being blown away by the food. This visit, the food was still delicious and unique, but a few dishes fell a little short of expectations.

First of all I love Bang for the unique concept - Asian small plates. I loveee Asian food and trying lots of items so this was perfect for me. The ambiance is also quite nice, although at first we were seated at a table right next to the door where we basically shivered every time the door opened; we then asked to move to a table upstairs and got a much more intimate spot even though there was a short wait. 

I also LOVE that almost all dishes are vegetarian / vegan or gluten-free. I was able to try so much of the menu which I'm never able to do! I'll list some of the hits and some of the misses:

Hits: Goat Cheese Dumplings (eat these hot - I hate cilantro and still was fine with the cilantro sauce they come with), Fried Rice Balls (chewy, hearty, satisfying), Kale Tortellini, Brussels Sprouts 

Misses: Eggplant Noodles (hard to eat, not chewy as expected), Avocado Wontons (avocado fell out during frying apparently because ours were basically empty), Roasted Beets (pretty good but nothing mind-blowing)

Overall we would come back if new items were added to the menu (which they constantly are shifting and changing items)! Lovely & special date night spot.",194,14

Murry C.,07/02/23,,,1,5,"We took a party of eight to Bang! to celebrate our 35th wrdding anniversary. We have been before but the others had not. We had excellent food and excellent service. Our waitress, Maya, could not have been any better. Every dish we had was better than the last. My husband's fave is the pork belly. I think mine  is the goat cheese dumplings. I had two of the sin city martinis and would like to have had a pitcher of it. I tell everyone that Bang! is my favorite C'ville restaurant!",16,17
Ashley R.,30/03/23,,,,5,"We chose Bang! for my birthday celebration this week and we're so happy we did. Great for special occasions or slightly fancier date nights (for us, we aren't fancy). 

I especially love the huge vegan selection and choice of several mocktails. You won't be missing out by skipping alcohol and animal products! 

We got:
* crispy sesame rice balls 
* chili roasted carrots and broccoli w/ sesame cashew sauce 
* avocado citrus salad with radish passion fruit dressing 
* curried kale and potato dumplings 
* matcha raspberry panna cotta 
* ""not a wrecking ball"" mocktail

The star of the show was the rice balls!! But everything we got was amazing. Service was great too and the food came out fast. 

Perfect for a vegan experience that would leave even omnivores satisfied.",200,256
Serena X.,05/05/23,,,,4,"first time coming to bang 4.5 overall 
after hearing so many good things from friends. I came here with 3 other friends, and we ordered a total of around 4 main dishes and each ordered 2 buns. 

I was hesitant about the buns at first, but they were extremely soft, flavorful and creamy, my favorite being the short rib bao buns. My friends loved the chicken buns as well. We also ordered the shrimp, Brussels sprouts, cheesy rangoons, and fried chicken dumplings. 

Atmosphere was cute with outdoor seating options. I do have to say maybe the company here swayed my view, but overall, I highly recommend it for some nice Asian inspired tapas!",227,132
Loredana K.,23/05/23,,,,4,"I'd give this a 4.5 out of 5

First time coming here & it was great! Didn't know what to expect since it was my first time ordering  at a place where you pick and choose multiple dishes. I got the goat cheese dumplings (10000/10!) and the Pork lettuce wrap.  

We sat outside and it was so pretty. Staff was friendly. Pretty expensive, but I knew it would be. I will definitely come back again!!

Pros- easy for your group to order multiple different plates and share. Great drinks. Vegan, vegetarian, and Gluten free options. Everyone can find something they like. 

Cons- because of the different dishes, my friends got their food way before me. My friend was done with her food before mine came. Didn't know how to properly order b/c we weren't explained the process (now I know to circle which items I want-- not a big problem at all). Wasn't much signage outside, so it was hard to find at first. 

Like I stated earlier, I will 100% return. Would recommend for a unique dinner experience.",9,51
Juliette S.,23/05/23,,,,5,This is always great and my friends and I love to eat there and we laugh loud and hope they don't mind! The food and service from the waitresses are awesome.

K R.,05/08/23,,,,1,"Wildly unimpressed!  Tables were sticky, bowl was chipped, don't understand the ambiance, and server thinks Tapas means bring the order in random increments (vice small plates).  Oh- and they spray a ridiculous amount of Fabuloso while you're trying to eat.  We won't waste our money here again!",2,
Lena M.,29/08/23,2,,2,4,"Checked Bang! out for a friend's birthday party.

***LOCATION***
This restaurant is only a couple blocks away from the Charlottesville's Historic Downtown Mall. There is a parking lot in front of it that you have to pay for. However, if you come on a Sunday or after 6pm, it's free to park there.

***EXPERIENCE***
We were a group of four. The friends I went with love this place and were excited to order for us. It's an Asian fusion tapas place. The service is a bit strange here because they grab your menu (you mark what you want and how many dishes of it) and then they disappear. It felt like they were throwing the dishes on our table and running away. At one point, they threw a dish we didn't order and before we could say something, they were already gone. I had to flag down a waiter to let them know the dish must've been for someone else. Ignoring that, we had a great time. We ordered:

Tempura sweet potatoes with hot honey feta:
This was probably my favorite dish we ordered. It wasn't covered in any sauce and the hot honey feta really complimented the fried sweet potatoes.

Goat cheese dumplings with cilantro sauce:
A lot of reviews raved about this and I understand why. We ordered two of these (they come with four dumplings), but we were stuffed by the time they came out at the end. These were one of the best things we ordered. I loved the curry flavors of the cilantro sauce. It really complimented the goat cheese. The dumplings themselves were crunchy which was really nice.

Flash fried brussels with miso mayo and sweet soy:
The brussels sprouts still had a bit of a crunch which was nice, however this dish felt like it was drowning in the miso mayo.

Ahi tuna poke tacos, pineapple, edamame:
Felt a bit drowned in the mayo sauce. The crunch of the taco shell was nice. Loved all the colors in this dish and what they were going for.

Firecracker shrimp, spicy garlic sauce:
This dish is not spicy, but the fried shrimp is delicious. Another dish covered in sauce.

Red pepper & feta rangoons:
They had a nice crunch and felt like a yummy crunchy and cheesy snack. I appreciated the sauce on the side.

BBQ pork belly, miso mayo pickled daikon:
It's a bit hard to share one of their steamed buns, so we each got our own. I ordered this one and enjoyed it. The bun is very thick and filling. The pork belly was quite delicious.

I had mixed feelings about the food. Some things were pretty yummy and others were just fine. A lot of things had a bit too much sauce for my liking. I felt like there was A LOT of dairy in these dishes, but that's probably due to what my friends ordered.

***PRICE***
We split the bill four ways and paid about $36.

***BATHROOM***
I only noticed one single stall here. It was gender neutral. It had a bit of a smell, but was clean otherwise. 

***CONCLUSION***
I really love the concept and what they're going for here. Some dishes are great while others don't hit the mark for me. I'd still recommend checking out this restaurant and getting things like the goat cheese dumplings and the tempura sweet potatoes.",667,1190
Alison L.,12/11/23,,,,3,"Food was delicious, served tapas style. We loved everything we ordered. Service, on the other hand, was pretty terrible. It was busy, but seemed well-staffed enough. It took 15 minutes - and a request from me - to get water. The food came out pretty smoothly and it was great, with 10-15 minutes or so between each plate. But then we waited 20 minutes with just empty plates in front of us for our waitress to ask if we wanted another drink or if we were ready for the bill while we were actually still waiting for a final plate we had ordered. There was never any acknowledgement of the slow service. In summary: great food, bad service.",2,
Jessi S.,14/11/23,1,1,2,5,"It is SO fun to come here with a group so you can just try as many things as possible! Of course we ordered more than we could handle - but so happy we did! There were several interesting dishes and other staples that we've previously had. Again, the steamed buns could've used more meat filling. The roasted duck noodles, red pepper and goat cheese dumplings, and short rib empanada were absolutely top 3. The pickles are also to die for! Some not so favorites were the naan with cinnamon butter...that's really it!",437,386
Arynn A.,27/11/23,1,,,3,Staff was very nice and professional. Good vibes. But I ate too much greasy food here and threw up at Holiday Inn,1,

Erin H.,29/01/24,,,,5,Went for restaurant week.  Second year in a row and it did not disappoint.  I'd highly recommend checking this spot out for restaurant week it's only $35 per person and the portions are huge.  We took home enough food for two more meals.  The top hits were the bulgogi beef lettuce wraps - super tender and the kimchi was on point.  The tiki masala was packed with flavor and the Nan was obviously homemade - airy and pillowy goodness.  The goat cheese dumplings didn't disappoint - I've had them before so I knew what to expect.  The pork spring rolls were a delight unto itself.  The mushroom noodles were not a highlight - needed more heat (I'd go with the firecracker shrimp instead in hindsight).  The Brussels sprouts came out first and were tasty - your typical fried Brussel sprouts so I can't say I thought they were anything special.  There was some confusion on what was included so we ended up with 2 deserts but the comped one - we took those along with a ton of leftovers to go.  All in all a wonderful meal.  I had the season mule which was tart with a little heat - very refreshing.  My date had the blackberry bourbon drink (don't remember the name) they thoroughly enjoyed it.  All in all a wonderful meal.,60,109
Courtney T.,02/02/24,1,,1,3,"We heard good things about Bang but were disappointed with our meals during restaurant week. Here's a breakdown of what we ordered!

Goat cheese pierogis with cilantro sauce: as a fan of goat cheese, these were just missing something. Don't know what, the dough was cooked well but just felt incomplete. Cilantro sauce didn't have much flavor.

Smoked Salmon Naan: best item of the night in my opinion! Would have been good to have toasted the naan a bit. It was just cold naan cut up into pieces.

Bulgogi lettuce wraps: greasy, fell apart. Couldn't eat as a lettuce wrap and lacked bulgogi flavor. Moreso tasted like pot roast with kimchi. Still good, but not bulgogi.

Crab Wontons: good, sauce is very sweet but complemented the crab filling.

Kale tortellini: honestly, did not like these at all. I like kale, I like brown butter. These were not tortellini like I know them (those little round stuffed pasta guys). And the flavor was just not there. 

Hot honey chicken: verygood but not spicy at all. Could have used more sauce.",227,8
Caitlin M.,09/02/24,,,,5,Everything we ate was amazing. From the fried chicken to the cauliflower. The bao buns were perfection. Great service. Great food. Love how it has a homey historical vibe.,39,
Sharon C.,15/02/24,,,,5,The Asian fusion at BANG is excellent.  The small plate servings are great.  The BBQ beef short ribs tapas were great.  Chickpea egg rolls and brownie bite cheese cake were all great .  Christi our server made excellent suggestions.  Loved the experience as well! We highly recommend this restaurant.,1,
Ivy W.,03/03/24,,,,3,"I honestly thought this place was a bit overrated. The food was okay. I had two different bao buns. But it was crazy expensive, especially the 15$ drinks and it was nearly impossible to get the servers attention. It seemed like they didn't want to interact at all and I would have to basically yell excuse me in order to ask a question before they ran from the table. There is an automatic gratuity added to the bill and the servers seem to take that as an excuse to avoid helping. Overall mid.",8,
Sarah S.,04/03/24,,,,4,"Came to Bang! For a friend's birthday dinner, we had a section reserved for about 9 people upstairs. Our section was cozy but very roomy. This is a unique experience as you check off items from a paper, give the paper to the server and they bring out your dishes. They offer a variety of vegetarian/non vegetarian dishes and a large cocktail menu. The lighting was really dark so I couldn't take good photos without an obnoxious flash but the food was very good! We ordered a pork bun, pickles, furikake edamame, firecracker shrimp, and the mushroom drunken noodles. Their menu did vary from the menu online. Each bun is $4 and the portion size is worth it in my opinion. I was a little dissapointed with the pickles, I thought it would be a variety of pickled veggies but it was just a little bowl of pickled cucumbers. The shrimp and drunken noodles were amazing!! Edamame were so so. This is a great place for groups in my opinion they offer something for everyone!!",122,290
Evelyn S.,31/03/24,,,,5,"All around delightful - foo is fabulous, service is great. The most unexpectedly delicious is the brussel sprouts, but ev we had was great.",16,1
Erina F.,17/04/24,,,,1,"So food is pretty good, but the service is terrible. Enough for me to want to write something about it. Waited 30 minutes for water. Our first tapa came out before I had anything to drink, and I only got it because I asked the bartender. An hour later, as we patiently wait for the rest of our tapas to arrive, the waitress asks if we need anything. I told her we were just waiting for our last two tapas. She gives a surprised look, says nothing else, then goes back to the kitchen. 15 minutes after that one of the tapas arrives. Another 15 for the tapa after that, and by this point, they actually have the waiter and food runner checking if we are still waiting for our short ribs. Not sure what was going on. Lots of employees walking around and not a lot of tables for a slow 6pm Wednesday dinner. Not worth the trouble going here.",9,
Tina V.,26/04/24,,,,2,"watered down asian food, if you can even call it that, that is made specifically for white people

korean bbq lettuce wraps taste nothing like korean bbq. seasoned with what tastes like mccormick steak seasoning lol. just because there's sesame on it doesn't make it ""korean""

popcorn shrimp was pretty good i won't lie

goat cheese dumplings were horrendous in my opinion, but if you like goat cheese then you'd probably like it

chicken was meh

i guess if you're white and don't normally have asian food to understand what's good and what isn't then you'd probably enjoy it but if you're looking for actual asian food and not whatever the hell this is just go to maps and look at the ten other asian restaurants in a 500 feet radius. two stars because the shrimp was actually not bad and the waiter was nice",5,
Andrew S.,17/05/24,3,1,5,3,"Very interesting flavors here at Bang. It truly is a fusion restaurant. Not sure what happened, but everything we ordered was fried. Oops! Our party of two ordered five dishes to share. We had the Chickpea Spring Rolls, General Tso's Cauliflower, Goat Cheese Dumplings, Avocado Wontons, and Pork Belly Rice. My personal favorites were the cauliflower and pork belly. In fact, the pork belly is to die for. Incredible flavors and went well with the hot and crispy rice. Cauliflower was nice and crispy too. The other dishes were just okay. I would describe the spring rolls as a very tiny Samosa wrapped like a roll. The sauce is the same sauce you would get with an Indian Samosa. Avocado Wontons and the Dumplings were okay.
 
Service was fast. Ordering is simple, but not the most interactive method. Very little communication with the servers, but receipt starts tip at 20%. So am I tipping based on just food? It was busy out and not a ton of parking in the area. There are several lots for paid parking.",1268,4808
Lauren M.,25/05/24,,,,5,"When I tell you...this place is always worth the trip. I remember coming here in college when it was more of a sushi bar with plenty of alcohol to keep you going all night long. 
The menu is more Asian fusion meets tapas and the flavors do not disappoint. 
The food comes out very quickly, so come hungry and order like you mean it. 

They've got something for the Asian adventurous as well as those who like to play it safe. Vegan friendly and gluten-free friendly options also. 

I highly recommend: 

General Tso's cauliflower 
Drunken noodles 
Beef short rib bao buns 
Mushroom bao buns 
Coconut rice 
Crab wontons 

Not a big fan of... the chickpea spring rolls and the mushroom wontons. 

Girls was my favorite cocktail, so I would say choose your favorite flavor combo and go for it!",165,27

Matthew C.,25/08/24,,,,2,"Asian fusion tapas sounded like a fun idea, so we visited Bang! on a Saturday night. We were seated quickly and ordered the pickles, pork belly bao, fried chicken bao, tempura zucchini, and pork belly friend rice. We really wanted to like this place, but it ended up being gross. The bao buns were totally raw in the center and looked more like pallid bean bags than sandwiches. Most of the tempura batter on the zucchini had run off, leaving the scalding hot vegetable with a few chunks of burnt dough clinging to the edges. The fried rice was the best dish we tried, but $18 for an appetizer-sized bowl of rice left a different kind of bad taste in our mouths. The lukewarm warm tap water was a welcome, if underwhelming, relief from the food. Our waiter was friendly and prompt.",1,175
Claire R.,10/09/24,,,,4,"Loved dinner here on Tuesday! It wasn't that busy, easily sat on the front porch and people watched. The ambiance is very cute and pretty laid back - it's in a renovated house with indoor, front porch, and back porch seating.

It's tapas style with delicious drinks! The portion sizes are pretty large - they recommended ~2 a person but maybe 1.5 would be fine. There are plenty on options for vegan and gluten free. There's also street parking!

Best items:
Drinks! I got the strawberry moon and it was fantastic so fresh!
General Tso's Cauliflower: not too fried or sauced, you can still taste the cauliflower which I appreciate
Beets: perfectly cooked
Brussels sprouts: comes with an orange sauce with was delicious!",45,
Jonathan N.,12/10/24,,,,2,"We went with high expectations but we were extremely dissatisfied! Our ""waiter"" brought our drinks and took our order only to never show up again! Literally sat there for 45 minutes without food, water refill or anything! I am convinced we were forgotten about!

Georgia J.,23/10/24,,,,4,"We loved our meal at Bang!

Sitting outside was very enjoyable!",52,
Zara T.,13/12/24,,,1,4,"The food was delicious!! We were in town and this place was recommended by a friend. It definitely lived up to the hype! 

Our server was helpful and got us going with drinks. You mark off what you'd like to eat and then they bring it out ""tapas style"" as it's ready. 

The building is a house, so we were sitting likely in the living room (lol). It's quirky, and I wish we could've sat outside. But it was good! This is a good spot for a date night or dinner with a few friends (more so than large groups). 

They do not have hot sake, which we were hoping for on a cold night. My only other complaint, and really it's a me thing, was that food came out really fast. We wanted to sit and enjoy the drinks, the food, the company. We were scrambling to finish and make room on our tiny two-top. 

Small thing! I'm sure it works for others... I'm a slower eater. 

Pro tip: order food a little at a time. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs!",241,69
