Lumiere S.,24/06/16,10,6,21,5,"Huzzah! Doma proves to be one of the more authentic modern Korean restaurants in the city. We came here for a Friday lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the fresh ingredient display, friendly service, and rustic modern decor. It's clear the staff here take their space seriously! From the wood accents on the walls to the charming succulents near the condiments, there was a lot of details put into the design of the restaurant. 

During our time, we ordered from the pre-set menu at the register. It looked like there was DIY dishes with the ingredients bar, but we did not use it. While the menu does not necessarily use the most traditional titles for the dishes, the flavor is definitely packed in there. I ordered the bento box with spicy pork, extra kimchi, and my significant other ordered the bbq burger with kimchi slaw and a side of fries. Oh. My. Goodness. 

The spicy pork was tender, succulent, and reminiscent of all those late night K-bbq back in my hometown. (If I closed my eyes, it almost felt like I was back in K-town all over again.) The bbq burger was incredible as well. The meat was tender, full of tangy yet savory sauce and the mayo was excellent. The additional sides of kimchi were good but I would have loved more! I also ordered a citrus slushi with real pieces of fruit hand cut and blended with ice. It was very sweet but refreshing for a hot summer day. Overall, if you're moderately hungry the serving size for the lunch portion should be enough for one person. However, if you're in beast mode, consider adding an extra side or two to satiate that appetite!

April the owner was very sweet. She made time to stop by our table to provide samples of the ginger slushi and asked us about our food. Apparently the place is still in their soft open mode, so there may be changes made to service style and menu options. Rumor has it there will be more traditional Korean dishes and desserts added in the future as well as a full service sit-down option for dinner. (I'm secretly not-so-secretly hoping they bring patbingsu to the table!) 

I would definitely recommend trying this place and bringing your friends!",205,853
Ziv H.,09/08/16,1,1,2,4,"There's a giant Korean food gap in C'ville.   No proper BBQ, nor deeper korean menus. The population doesn't support it-- you have to head to Fairfax VA.
Doma bridges a gap. It's a quick-cook restaurant that balances some choose-your-own ingredients with a lighter korean fare, served quick.

Given that niche (and aimed at that level), this is definitely nicer than 'Zz--m' (a different K fast food place).  
A very nice Bibimbap complete with a fresh sunny side egg in too. It ain't Seoul, but this is C'ville and I will be back for lunches for sure. Go!",230,12
Ellie D.,28/08/16,6,5,9,5,"Wow- what a great dinner we enjoyed here.
We had:
Korean chicken wings- so delicious, crispy, perfectly coated and good size
Fried dumplings- great flavor, could have used more/better dipping sauce

Korean BBQ plate: generous of bulgogi- cooked to perfection, nicely caramelized and great flavor. Served with lettuce, rice, kimchi, sauce and veggies. Made into a wrap that was so amazing. Every component by itself was delicious. 

Udon noodles (can't remember the name/not the seafood version). We had chicken in this dish and it was so good! Yummy veggies and fat udon noodles in a slightly sweet sauce, not overpowering. It was delicate yet fulfilling. The noodles seemed a heavy towards the end but were so balanced by the still crunchy veggies. I will dream of this dish. 

Overall, this was a great meal. The staff was really kind and very responsive. Truly a great spot to enjoy tasty Korean food.",79,32
Kevin W.,24/09/16,2,3,3,4,"This place was quite scrumptious. I went with a friend and we ordered the bbq platter and the stir fried udon with pork. The wait staff and time we're both very nice and accommodating. Even though it was very crowded, we got our orders in as soon as we were ready. 

The food itself was very good. The pork belly in the bbq was tender and the udon was delicious. I found the spicy pork a little bit sweet which I didn't enjoy, but other than that everything was really good. We were also constantly checked on by our waitress and we felt like we got everything we wanted in terms of service. 

Overall, this place was great for a quick bite - it was kind of pricy, the udon was $11 and the bbq platter was $15, but it wasn't unreasonable. I would definitely come again and recommend this place strongly!",33,501
Carl C.,11/11/16,3,1,4,4,"Just got off the local train station in Charlottesville for a nice weekend break. So, I look for the nearest restaurant/cafe with a decent and reasonable menu. I did not have to go far when I saw the sign for DOMA. It's just right across from the station.

At the first bite of my spicy pork bbq burger at this restaurant, you got me. The burger had great flavor, the right amount of kimchi and spice, along with plentiful and various veggies, and the meat portions/slices in the burger were ideal

....and they have slushies! So, the lemon slushie went well with my lunch items.

(I am hoping this isn't a fluke, because I am coming back here whenever I'm in Charlottesville)

Service was fast and the chef gave the right recommendation for a hungry and weary traveler like me. 4.5 stars out of 5 stars",129,105
Onvara A.,05/02/17,1,,2,5,"I got the Dolsot Bibimbap (rice with stir fried onions, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts, zucchini, kale, sunny-side up egg, organic tofu, and spicy gochujang sauce). Everything in this dish was amazing! I would definitely recommend getting it.

My friend ordered the Doma Bokum Udon (stir-fried udon noodles with onion, bok choy, carrots, scallions, organic tofu, and sweet soy sauce). It was pretty good, but much blander than the bibimbap. It could've used some more sauce to give it more flavor.

One downside was that parking was hard to find because of the location. I wish they had a private lot because I would definitely come more often!",619,41
Lynn N.,08/03/17,2,,3,5,"Walked by randomly and decided to give it a try. Not only am I excited to see a Korean place in Charlottesville, the food was really good. 

We sat down and ordered dolsot bibimbap with tofu which came in a hot stone bowl and kimchi jjigae. The kimchi jjigae had a rich, wonderful flavor to it. It definitely warms you up on a cold day. It also came with pickled radishes and those were delightful. 

I am coming back here for sure. There were so many things I wanted to try. I didn't even realize there was stir fry. I'm happy I stopped there that day.",42,21
Corinne O.,02/04/17,1,,3,4,"Doma -- an eclectic Korean kitchen tucked just steps away from Charlottesville's picturesque pedestrian mall. There is a modern flare that recalls the pioneer past of rural Virginia. Music, change it. The food is fantastic. The kimchi pancakes, dumplings, and the barbecue plate are all to die for. The hot Bibimbap is also very good. Ask for chopsticks if you want them. Great place vegetarians as well as people with allergies. The service could have been a little faster but wasn't horrible. 

- Corinne and Kara",26,471
Carol F.,09/05/17,2,1,2,4,"I had never expected to find many authentic Korean places on the streets of Charlottesville, but was very pleasantly surprised by DOMA!

Bf and I were looking for a place to chow down after work, and first impression that the place is fast casual, due to the food station being out in the open. Looked like chipotle style. However, you don't order there - you take a seat and get full service. I liked that, because it's a place casual enough that you don't expect to sit too too long, but can still have a full on feast, like we did :P

We started with the soy garlic wings for appetizer. Saucy with balanced flavor. If I were more adventurous that day I would've gone for the 911...someone try it and tell me how it is :3

I had the ddokbokki, which is rice cakes in a red sauce. I must've been treating myself out to something that day, cause I added both cheese and ramen to that dish. Which I recommend! Definitely couldn't finish it in one sitting though. The cheese makes the red sauce super rich, and also everything is just better with cheese. 

Bf had the bibimbap, which was good, although we wished it was served with more hot red paste on the side, since it's usually added to your personal taste. 

I also believe that sides of kimchi should be complimentary...$3.50 for a tiny plate is a bit steep...but it was good nonetheless. 

Go give it a try!",255,606
Gilbert G.,06/07/17,2,,1,4,"This was a pleasant surprise to find traditional Korean food in C-ville.   My wife, two sons (11 yrs, 9 yrs) and I arrived for early dinner (5:45pm) on a Wednesday, and were seated promptly.  On the plus side, we liked the interior design of the restaurant and open kitchen. Both the Kimchi Pajun (pancake) appetizer and Dolsot Bibimbap (with beef) were delicious.  My younger son enjoyed the mandu (steamed dumplings).  On a muggy day in July, it was especially refreshing to drink a cold glass of Kirin Ichiban beer that paired well with the Kimchi Pajun.  Overall, I would strongly recommend DOMA if you're visiting C-ville and have a craving for traditional Korean food.  

On the minus side, parking can be a challenge. If you're coming by car, it may be difficult to find nearby parking on Main St. during peak hours.  However, C-ville plans to implement new paid parking meters in September 2017.  DOMA is within walking distance of the UVA campus.",556,35
Angel H.,19/07/17,3,2,4,5,"One of my favorite restaurants in C'ville! This is my fourth time here; I've just been waiting to take good pictures before I write my review. 

The food here is amazing! There's plenty to pick from so you'll definitely find something you enjoy. The Dolsot Bibimbap is one of my favorites! It's a stone bowl of rice mixed with lots of fresh bean sprouts, zucchini, kale, and a meat of your choice (spicy pork is delicious and so is beef!). It's topped with a fried egg and comes with this spicy sauce. Absolutely fantastic dish! The rice gets all nice and crispy from the hot stone bowl, and the meat is juicy and very well seasoned. Portion size is huge for $12.50. The fresh veggies also give it an overall refreshing taste. 

The Soondubu Jjigae (soft tofu with seafood) is also excellent! It's a spicy kimchi stew that's perfect for cold days. It comes with banchan and a bowl of rice. The banchan is fantastic! I love the pickled radish and carrots, kale, and kimchi. It pairs perfectly with the spicy stew. The tofu is really soft and silky and the seafood is fresh. 

Service is great and there are plenty of seats. There is a 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. Happy hour is from Tuesday to Friday from 3-7pm. Really cheap drinks! Highly recommend DOMA even though parking can be a hassle sometimes. It's hit or miss with the street parking really, but definitely worth it for Doma. Good food, good service, good price.",510,454
Amanda P.,05/11/17,,,1,4,"Got the classic bibimbap with beef. Really yummy with crispy rice on the hot bowl!

Went on Friday night and they were SUPER busy. You could tell that they were a little overwhelmed so just be aware that service is slow (but not unfriendly!).

Would definitely come back to try more.",396,82
Victoria H.,12/11/17,,,,3,"Came here on a Friday night around 8 with some friends. The restaurant was very packed with people and we were told it would be a 15 minute wait. Unfortunately there wasn't really anywhere to wait, so we stood by the door until we were seated.

We started with the vegetable dumplings which were crispy and delicious! For my entree I ordered the bibimbap with tofu. It was good but honestly nothing special. It had rice, mushrooms, zucchini, and some other vegetables, tofu, and a fried egg with a side of spicy sauce. The tofu was very bland and not crispy at all. The sauce added some flavor (but use caution because it's very spicy!). My egg was completely runny and undercooked and the bowl wasn't hot when it arrived at the table-it was slightly warm and became cold quickly.

I was underwhelmed with the food, but I will say that there is another bibimbap entree that comes in a hot stone bowl (it's a little bigger portion too I think) that's a little more expensive; it would be worth it to try this one instead because I think it keeps the food hot for much longer.

The restaurant has a very urban feel with light bulbs and pipe fixtures. I also like that the kitchen is open next to the booths so you can watch the chefs.

Overall: food was underwhelming, no waiting area, but good ambiance.",109,311
Haley M.,19/11/17,,,2,5,"Love, love, love it here!  I live in CA but am fortunate to visit Charlottesville every couple of months for business (and for DOMA)! I always make it a point to come here, I don't crave many things but this place is one of them.  There's not much else I can say that hasn't already been said by fellow Yelpers.  
Lunch and dinner are both great.  The service may seem slow to some but I don't think of it as such.  I appreciate that they don't rush you and try to get you in and out right away. 

Just go here.  You won't be disappointed.  Get the Dolsot Bibimbap and the wings.  My mouth is watering as I write this review.  Now I need to go plan my next trip here!",91,135
Zach B.,09/12/17,,,,4,"I know next to nothing about Korean food, but Doma was as good an introduction as I could've hoped for! I got the Ojingeo Twigim (fried squid) and Dubu Kimchi (kimchi and pork with tofu), and they made for quite the meal. The squid comes with a yummy vinegar-tasting sauce; you'll totally want to double dip. The squid itself was really hot and came out of the breading easily, but the taste was on point.

As for the kimchi--what a meal! The tofu comes in large pieces arranged around the pork and kimchi. The dish is beautiful and SO tasty! Definitely a go-to if you like spicy. I ended up running out of kimchi and pork before my tofu was finished, but the tofu has its own spicy flavor as well. Definitely not bland, as the haters might say ;)

If you're looking for a hip spot with interesting food, give Doma a try. There's little about it that won't impress.",18,60
Nikki M.,20/12/17,,,,4,"A little overpriced, but. I am comparing it to the prices in SoCal where there are a lot more Korean restaurants and process are more competitive. It's definitely not like the Korean food from Korean Town in LA. But their pancakes are really good. Their rameyeon was good but not great. I didn't really like the rice cakes in my ramyeon, the noodles were overcooked, and the broth was a bit bland.
The atmosphere was nice though. I enjoyed their decor.",70,17
Angelina P.,17/02/18,,,,4,"Praise for DOMA! I've been craving Korean food all week. I'm so fortunate that we got to stop by this place on the way home. It was very delicious, but the only downside was the service. I admit we did come a little late, almost close to closing time. Although, it seems that most places that we go to always prioritize the takeouts first. Which explains the rushing people. They also have an open kitchen and you can smell the tasty food. 

I would recommend the DOMA Lunch Box (lunch special). It comes with any type of meat or tofu, DOMA salad, and vegetables.

Also, parking is hard to find here so just mind that.

Considering a review from a half-Korean, overall the taste was great for my liking.",24,2
Ariel B.,25/08/18,,,2,5,"Definitely the best place to get Korean food in Cville. 

I've been here many times since they've opened and have always enjoyed the food here. The atmosphere is always great, the decor is nice, the restaurant itself is clean, and service is always fantastic. 

In terms of food I've always enjoyed every dish! I've ordered their tteokbokki (royal and non royal), japchae, soondubu, and kimchi jjigae and it was all tasty. I wouldn't say it's the best Korean food I've ever had but they do an excellent job. My personal favorite is the soondubu, and I always switch out the pork for beef and they have been very accommodating in that regard. 

I would say that the only downside is their pricing. I've eaten at many Korean restaurants and, excluding BBQ places, this is on the pricier side. 

Nevertheless still the best and tastiest in Cville!",365,332
Ana D.,04/11/18,,,1,3,We ordered several different plates. I thought the glass noodles with beef was good. And also the chicken wings and the dumplings. But I've also never had Korean food before. The group I was with said the only good thing was the glass noodles and they weren't good enough for them to come back. The middle dish (beef with rice and some sides) was very dry. Our server was a little sporadic. They were also very busy. 4 stars for value.,280,235
Oak Z.,31/01/19,1,,1,4,"Solid place for arguably the best Korean food in Charlottesville, which honestly is not saying much.  That being said, there is definitely no compromise to the quality here and I have always left satisfied with the food.  In a convenient location, DOMA does get pretty busy during evening hours towards the end of the week and the wait staff might need some more help.  However, the staff is nice and generally does a good job of making a meal a good experience.  The interior ambience of the restaurant itself is pretty exceptional yet indicative of most places in Charlottesville that have opened in the past 5 to 10 years.  Overall nice place for a Korean dish every now and then.  9/10 would recommend.",130,486
Clayton R.,13/03/19,1,,1,5,"The place is legit!  Friendly service, cool atmosphere and the food is second to none!

Had the Tteok Galbi (Chicken meatballs) - they were honestly a little dry but when dipped in whatever that deliciousness personified they call a sauce is they were really tasty.  

For the main dish I had the Dolsot Bibimbap with beef - so, so good in the hot stone bowl!

I'll definitely be back!",152,29
Carrie S.,01/04/19,1,,2,4,"The menu here is quite impressive! The meal I ordered, Dak Galbi, was so spicy that at times I could barely eat it. I would order it with rice next time to make it really good. I loved the portion sizes. The meat was super tasty and spiced just right. I would have liked a little guidance on the menu, as I might try something else next time. Overall, good service, super tasty food, satisfies your spice craving!!! I would definitely go back but I'd try something else on the menu.",116,160
Zhana E.,25/04/19,,,1,4,"The food is great here! I had the Dolsot Bibimbap. It's still cooking in the stone bowl when they ring it to the table. It smells good, looked good and tastes good! Between the 4 of us we also enjoyed and split the Goguma Twigim, and Mandu. We showed up here on a Friday night with no reservation and only had to wait 15 minutes (early in the evening). At first the service was fantastic but when out server changed it wasn't great. Definitely wasn't a consistent experience or vibe from server to server. We had to ask several times for the same thing, which wasn't a great way to end our time there.

I am definitely coming back to try some meals though!",114,186
Jess R.,12/05/19,,,1,4,"We really enjoyed this restaurant! Fast, reasonably priced Korean food, not entirely authentic, but still really good. Cool atmosphere. Would be a neat date night.  It is small, so not sure it would work for large parties.  The menu is large and diverse, and the food was good.  We got the bbq beef platter and a bibimbap.   Both were tasty, but I thought the side dishes could have more flavor.   Overall we enjoyed it and would go back!",229,147
Sally H.,09/06/19,1,,,5,"I am incredibly grateful to other Yelpers for pointing me to DOMA. Your reviews were accurate. I enjoyed a wonderful meal for under $20 that had 5-piece veggie mandu (crispy, hot, tasty) plus a filling bowl of the best bibimbop I have ever eaten. No that is not exaggeration. I have eaten Korean food in multiple countries and in the US on both coasts and many states in between, and without doubt this was a superlative example of the bibimbop dish. The meat (which elsewhere can be tough, stringy, too much fat, and a way to serve 3rd class meat) was perfect: moist, tender, not laden with fat or gristle. The range of other items (mushrooms, shredded carrot, noodles, egg, greens, and more) were perfectly proportioned for the amount of meat and rice. The spicy sauce served with it was strong but didn't overpower the dish--in short, this may have been the Ur Bibimbop upon which all others were based. I'm saddened that I did not take a photo of it before consuming it all. Sigh--guess I'll just have to return for another one!",312,67
Mason W.,22/06/19,3,3,2,5,"I live close to little Korea in San Diego, but have NEVER been a fan of Korean BBQ. Someone explained to me that Korean food is different than Korean BBQ. They likened it to someone thinking that all American food is BBQ. Ok, I get it now. Silly me! 

A friend suggested that I try the Bibimbap at DOMA Korean Kitchen since I'd be in Charlottesville, and have never actually had Korean food. I was reluctant because I was set on not liking Korean food. I ordered the bibimbap and it came out sizzling in a hot ass bowl, and had an egg on it. It reminded my of when I was in China. I didn't speak Mandarin so I drew a picture of a chicken laying an egg and they brought me out WHOLE chicken(head, feet and body), chopped up with an egg on top. I was like man! Not again. 

I took my first bite and 2 seconds later I was staring at an empty bowl. OMG!!! Bibimbap is so fricking good! Like absolutely delicious!!! I literally ate the food before it had a chance to cool down. The only reason that I know I ate it too fast is because the next day the roof of my mouth was scorched. Guess what? It was worth it. Every single bite was worth it. My mouth is watering as I'm typing this, and I just ate poke. 

Sometimes I'm not as opened-minded as I'd like to think I am. I think since I'm from California that everything is better here, but Charlottesville has impressed me in many ways. One of the main features being the food at Doma Korean Kitchen. My compliments to the Chef and the exceptional customer service that I received.",120,23
Ashley R.,09/07/19,3,1,1,5,"This was my first time trying Korean food and I absolutely loved it. A great experience all around. Really clean and bright atmosphere where you can see the kitchen and the fresh ingredients.

They have vegan options! I got the bibimbap (ask for no egg) with tofu and it was perfect.",200,256
Diana M.,04/08/19,1,,1,4,"This place was pretty good and affordable. It had a good variety of your usual korean food. Dolsot bibimbap was very good with a large portion. Prices were pretty average. My favorite part was the bathroom tbh :). It was very cute and rustic!

Pros:
- cute af bathroom
- food was pretty good. Mandu and dolsot bibimbop was what I got. The Mandu sauce was a little sweet for my taste, but I ate it all
- good prices
- fast / nice service

Cons:
- tables were very sticky
- banchan: potatoes tasted a little off? Kimchi was alright. Pickled radish and carrots were..weird tasting? I usually have it with the juice, but it just came out on a plate. The texture of the radish and carrots were soggy and not crunchy and refreshing tasting. These are complimentary I believe, but i also look forward to good banchan when I'm eating korean cuisine 
- egg in my bibimbop seemed a bit over fried. The yolk itself was runny enough though",24,43
Connie L.,29/09/19,,,2,4,"I came here for a solo dinner on a Wednesday evening in the summer of 2019 while in Charlottesville for business. The restaurant was within walking distance from the Residence Inn I was staying at, and is not too long of a walk from the Downtown Mall area. The restaurant was reasonably busy for a weekday night, but there were a good number of tables available when I arrived and I was seated immediately. 

I was trying to be vegan around this time, so I opted for the dolsot (hot stone bowl) tofu bibimbap minus the egg. This seemed like the safest option for a vegan dish; there were a few other options that seemed like they would definitely be vegetarian if not totally vegan, but Korean BBQ is usually so meat-focused that it's pretty normal for most of the menu to be meat-centric. 

The kitchen area is very open and if you're sitting facing the kitchen, it's cool to be able to watch them work while you wait for your food. In particular, I saw them putting the hot stone bowls for the dolsot bibimbap on the hob to heat up, which was neat. My food came out in a reasonable amount of time, and I was very satisfied with the portion size and the generous amount of veggies and tofu I got. The bibimbap came with a side of gochujang paste, but I didn't feel like I needed to use it since I'm not really huge on spicy food and I found the bibimbap to be flavorful enough on its own. Since the bibimbap keeps cooking in the stone bowl, it made the rice a bit crispy and kept everything nice and sizzling and hot for several minutes. 

The service was efficient and proactive; there wasn't a huge delay between when I finished my food and when they brought me my check. Each table is set up with a carafe of tap water, so I never had to wait for a server to come around to refill me during the meal. Overall the restaurant was clean and had a modern, bustling atmosphere, definitely helped by the open kitchen area. If you're in the area and craving Korean food, this is definitely a good option!",527,234
Jo L.,22/02/20,,,,5,"Great Korean-American food. My friend and I loved the bingsoo, especially since it's among the only in Charlottesville. The aesthetic of the restaurant was very rustic and beautiful and only added to the dining experience. I got the chicken wings, and it was so delicious. My only caveat is that parking can be a little difficult to find.",400,12
MP G.,06/03/20,1,,3,5,"I can't believe I'm finally writing a review especially after being here like more than 50x since it opened. Charlottesville's food scene is very good but had been lacking a proper non-fastcasual  Korean restaurant before Doma and Maru (another Korean restaurant in Charlottesville). This is generally my go-to Korean restaurant location due to prices being generally cheaper than downtown, and because it can fit more people. Here are my thoughts:

Decor: 5/5 Was always impressed at the interior. They kept the original ceiling since this is an older building, so it has this very rustic vibe. Plus the stone table bar and the open view kitchen (you can essentially see them cook your food and the all the fresh ingredients are beautifully laid out for you to see) adds a beauty detail to the ambience. 

Food: 5/5 I typically get the Korean BBQ plate which is your choice of barbecued meat (my favorite is spicy pork) with a side of rice, lettuce wraps, gochujang sauce, and ban Chan (a seasonal array of traditional appetizers that usually includes Kim chic, pickled radish, and one other seasonal side). Love the flavors, and the fresh vegetables. The spicy pork is not too spicy but you can always add additional sauce. Another favorite is their bibimbap which is a Korean rice bowl with your favorite barbecued meat, assorted vegetables, a side of gochujang and topped with a fried egg. Sometimes it comes with a side of their soup. Pro-tip is to pay the extra for a Dolsot bibimbap which serves it on a sizzling hot stone so the rice and other ingredients cook a little extra and become crunchy! 

A common favorite appetizers my friends get include tteok kochi (Fried rice cake skewers in spicy sauce that resembles gochujang) as well as Korean fried wings in either soy garlic or Korean hot. Finally we end with some bing soo which is shaved milk ice with other toppings and syrups. We love the strawberry flavors. 

Service 4.5/5 Love the friendly attitude and fast paced environment, you're normally seated within seconds of arriving if it's not too busy. I gave a 4.5/5 because when it is busy (which it usually is during dinner) it can take a  little bit to order and get your order. It sometimes feels like there's only one person taking your order and bringing them to your table despite having so many people working inside.",234,228
Sei Young Y.,09/03/20,1,,1,4,"- Always satisfies my korean food craving
- my go to is boodaejjigae (korean army stew)- comes with lots of toppings in a hot spicy broth (comes with rice)
- other menu items are great as well such as: kimchi fried rice and dolsot bibimbap
- service is decent
- parking: can parallel park or park in the pay parking lot across the street for $3/hr",75,321
Naomi M.,15/03/20,1,,,4,"Love Korean food (I used to live in Southern California very close to a Koreatown and growing up, we used to go over to a korean family's place often for lunch/dinner) and wasn't expecting to find much in Charlottesville. Doma is by far my favorite place to go for Korean food, albeit a little expensive for my taste but then again, I have to remember where I live. My go to dish is the soondubu jigae with seafood and it never fails to disappoint. I would also recommend their dolsot bibimbap and (for something special) bossam. The japchae here is not my favorite but I think it's because it's different from what I remember eating growing up. 

The service here is decent. Some servers are slower than others but the owner is always friendly and I always like supporting local restaurants. It can get quite popular in the evening so keep that in mind when planning a meal. Parking can also be annoying because it's street parking but honestly, that's the case for any restaurant in this part of town.",50,40
Annalisa M.,16/07/20,1,,1,5,"Pricey but delicious! 

Ordered the 5 piece chicken wings with chili, udon noodles, and pork bibimbap. Wings were crispy and had the perfect amount of sauce; accompanied with a cup of ginger. I really enjoyed the flavor(s). I also ordered the bibimbap, which never disappoints. Comes with crunchy kale, a fried egg, rice, carrots, and bean sprouts. Don't forget the chili sauce! Incredibly satisfying and great portions. Not to mention, everything comes in sustainable packaging or reusable plastic containers and each orders comes with napkins, salt and pepper, utensils, and chopsticks. 

Saved the udon noodles for lunch tomorrow!",192,415
Jimmy B.,19/07/20,1,,2,5,"The BBQ plate was a great size with traditional sides. The pork belly tasted amazing.

The tteokbokki with ramen noodles was a nice fusion of two dishes. It's perfect for those who like spicy food.

Ryan K.,09/11/20,,,1,3,"Not the best food but I may have ordered the wrong things. I ordered the corn cheese and the fried squid. The corn cheese was literally just some cheese melted on some corn. I don't know what I expected, but it really was not worth ordering. The fried squid dish was pleasantly spicy, but the squid were extremely chewy and the sauce was watery and unflavorful. I want to try something else from DOMA next time, but my first ordering from DOMA was a swing and a miss.",674,21
Lina J.,25/11/20,3,1,3,4,"I know, I know, it's probably not a fair comparison to put C'ville Korean food against NoVA Korean food. All in all, DOMA does a pretty good job!

The wings are delish - a little overpriced but the seasoning and crispness is perfect. They're not huge wings like Bonchon (but I kind of like that!). We've tried their kalbi as well - it's OK and I think definitely overpriced (might just save the kalbi for NoVA). Seafood sundubu is pretty good as well...for C'ville. Wish the banchan was a little bit more robust though (usually kimchi, some greens with sesame oil, and pickled radish) - would be awesome to have fish cake or soy bean sprouts etc. 

DOMA does a great job at contactless ordering and pick up. It is super easy to order food and super easy to pick up in store. The food is all packaged nicely - I've never had a problem with an order. Will be back, most likely for sundubu or wings :)",272,206
Lusia M.,16/01/21,,,1,5,"I had the Dolsot Bibimbap 3 days in a row while staying Downtown so far. So delicious. 
Once with no rice and extra veggies which I was told isn't the best way to order it but either way it's so good just less carbs. 
I've also had the Korean BBQ wings twice and they're a solid option, especially if you like crispy wings. 
The house salad is good but what takes it to the next level is the lemon dressing. It is one of my favorite all time dressings.",57,11
Andy N.,10/04/21,,,2,5,"I've heard so many raves about this place, and they lived up to their reputation.

I 100% recommend giving this place a try because they will not disappoint.",229,88
Tulshi P.,16/04/21,3,1,3,4,"The restaurant adheres to covid precautions very well, asking customers to leave on masks at all times unless they are eating or drinking.

I can here on a Thursday night without reservations and they were able to accommodate us. I ordered the doma udon noodles with the spicy red pepper sauce which were delicious. The bibimbap bowl was bland and needed to have more sauce added to it. Portions are great for sharing and dinner entrees are very reasonably priced.",483,154
Alexandra A.,20/05/21,1,,,4,"These meals were so good. I did not expect to eat the whole thing, but it was so tasty I couldn't stop eating. There was a good amount of chicken in the Udon. We got normal and spicy chicken. I can't wait to go back and try their wings.",148,25

I came here for a graduation dinner with my family. the staff was helpful in making a last minute reservation when almost all spots in town were full. 

the menu is diverse with enough offerings for different eaters but not too long as to be intimidating. there are the classic korean items like galbi, korean bbq, kimchi jjigae, etc.

the food was quick to come out, large in portion, fresh and delicious. i got the galbi and the family got mostly noodle dishes.

everyone was happy. the galbi was excellent, served with great kimchi, salad, and pickles.

especially interesting was the ice cream on (mochi?) waffle. crispy but with a gooey texture inside.",241,103
Lauren H.,24/06/21,1,,,5,What a fun restaurant! I loved the decor and the lighting. The food came out so quickly and the Mandu (vegetable dumplings) were delicious especially the dipping sauce. I also got the fried rice sticks on a skewer. It was very sticky and quite spicy. The udon noodles were nice and thick and everyone liked it! Overall wonderful :),269,38
Conifers J.,06/08/21,,,,3,"Had the bibimbap take out once and it was fantastic. Of course, I ordered it AGAIN but on the second bibimbap, apparently someone else made the banchan or individual elements bc those were not nearly well seasoned as the first time. Looking for consistency here. And anything served on rice has got to be great, bc well, rice. If it can't stand on its own it's a bit glaring. 

I'll most likely go back bc the first bibimbap was so good, esp the mushroom bits, the carrots, the sprouts, each of the individual elements was great (incl the kale), and I'd like to try the version in the hot stone bowl with crispy rice. Hope they iron things out by then. We still love the delivery, but I am slightly worried about the person making the banchan. Somebody needs to QA/QC.",134,5

Elizabeth E.,11/09/21,1,,1,5,"Stopped in last night with my boyfriend and it was amazing. We started off with the Tteok Galbi (chicken meatballs), which were probably a 4/5. They were definitely good, but could have used some heat. A very simple flavor profile that could have been enhanced with some chili or black pepper. 

For dinner we both had the Doma Korean BBQ plate. I had the beef, and he had the spicy pork. Both of our meals were really fantastic albeit in very different directions. Mine was the sweet tangy flavor of Korean BBQ beef. It was a simple profile, but a delicious one nonetheless. The pork was a nice blending of spice, heat, and acid. In terms of a heat level, I'd say it was a low medium rather than ""hot,"" but it was still really good! 

My boyfriend tried the sides, but admitted to being a bit disappointed by the kimchi because he thought it was a little too acidic. 

Personally, I thought Everything in the entire restaurant looked amazing, and I fully anticipate we will be returning to try more of their menu soon. 

The restaurant also had a great vibe and an exposed kitchen creating a really amazing atmosphere. Overall, a great restaurant.",141,167

Mary Lou H.,23/09/21,,,,2,"Doma Bokum Udon

This was super oily and bland and not pleasant to eat. The chicken in the dish was flavorful

I'm relatively new to the area and had heard great things about Doma  I ordered this as take out.  Temp when I got it home was fine. I'm trying to eat light and healthy, I had skipped lunch the day I ordered so was ok with having the noodles.

It was super disappointing .. a total  grease bomb.  The mix of veggies to protein to noodles was good.. and was happy for the veggies and they were well cooked.  The chicken I'd ordered had good flavor but overall it just tasted like noodles and veggies in oil.  

No thanks.  Not sure if the cook today doesn't know the proportions, but no way that much fat is needed in this dish.  I had ordered the sweet soy version and it wasn't sweet any the soy was undetectable in all the fat.  Ended up dishing it onto paper towels and poured out the grease in the bottom.. it was still too greasy to eat. 

Much less fat and more flavor please!",2,
Josh M.,23/09/21,,,,5,Was going through The town and decided to stop by this restaurant. Did not regret it. Food was delicious and staff were very friendly! No doubt a 5/5 restaurant,4,118
Chat C.,25/09/21,2,,1,4,"Ordered takeout knowing that it was going to be jam packed with people, and I couldn't really wait around for a seat.  

Also, their phone forever rings into a full voicemail. Called 4 times, no one picked up but it's all good. Online ordering works. 

Ordered their Kimchi Jeon (kimchi pancakes) appetizer and it was good! Dipping sauce helped balance the flavor. 

For the main meal, ordered Bibimbap. One was chicken and the other was beef. Beef will forever be the better choice as it can soak up the marinade and make the beef more flavorful. Chicken wasn't bland, but wasn't savory. 

Oh also, runny egg yolk was a little misleading with its look. On the surface, it was kind of runny, but the yolk cooked halfway in. Just need to fry the egg in hotter temp with more oil, please! Give us those crispy edges, I'm not a savage. 

Overall, it was a good Korean meal, as this was my first in the area and do not know if C'ville has other options. I am excited to try more of their stuff on the menu!",166,333

The beef was tender, and the veggies were delicious and super fresh. All the flavors complemented each other so well, and the fried egg on top just sealed the deal. The dish itself was so beautiful that I almost didn't want to dig in. The bowl was huge, and came with a small miso soup . We also got some mango soju, which was super yummy: it really tasted like fresh mango! Lighting fast service (our food was in front of us within 10 minutes of ordering), great atmosphere, and very reasonable prices. If you haven't been to DOMA yet, go ASAP!!",168,27
Linh L.,06/12/21,,,2,2,"I had to knock 2 stars off for the service I received when I revisited Doma. I called to make a reservation a day in advance and got confirmation that my table would be ready at 6PM. However when I walked in, the waitress told me they had lost my reservation and that we could sit at a different reserved table, but needed to leave around 7. We ordered our food and it came pretty quickly. My dolsot bibambap egg had a huge piece of eggshell in it. We finished eating around 6:45 and tried to get our check but no one came to check on us in the latter half of us eating. Finally at 6:55, a different waitress came back saying ""sorry this is a reserved table you guys need to leave"" and before giving us our checks. We were trying to put our cards and cash in the checkbooks but she kept telling us to leave before even getting our money. Then when she came back to return our cards, she barely gave us any time to write our tips down before shooing us out. The rushing, along with the eggshell in my bibambap really soured my experience with Doma.",56,5
Justin N.,07/01/22,,,3,4,"I had been meaning to try this place out for a while. I finally came here with a friend for dinner. The inside of the restaurant is cute. It is warmly lit and has an open kitchen where the cooks can be seen preparing dishes. The cooking is good but coming from Northern Virginia I've definitely had better Korean food.
 
I tried the Doma Korean BBQ Plate with Pork Belly. The dish comes with banchan sides. My order wasn't served with any sauce for the pork belly. I requested sauce and was glad that they had a mildly spicy ssamjang dipping sauce which was great for the pork belly. I highly recommend requesting it with the Korean BBQ plate order. The dish tasted good; however, it definitely isn't the best Korean barbecue pork belly that I've had. The pork belly wasn't as fatty and wasn't grilled as well as I would have liked.
 
The Dolsot Bibimbap was good. It was a nice portion of food for a good price. The rice was crispy. It was a good bowl of bibimbap that I'd probably get again if return to Doma and I'm craving the dish.
 
Overall, Doma is a cute Korean restaurant in Charlottesville. The food is good, but I wouldn't say amazing. It's definitely not the best Korean food place that I've been to but it's an enjoyable experience. It's good spot for a casual sit-down dinner.",372,109
Ron Y.,07/01/22,,1,7,2,"Summary: the server strong-armed me into tipping her on a takeout order.

This may have been the third but certainly the final time I'll eat here. The food and service is mediocre, at best. I've called in orders before and spoke in Korean to try and be polite in an effort to show support for the Asian American business but the woman taking my orders always sounded reluctant to acknowledge this and would answer in English. Fine, maybe they prefer English. But don't sound irritated that I'm choosing to give you business. Even when dining-in, when the restaurant is nearly empty, there's no sense of urgency to acknowledge customers want to be seated. Last night was the final straw when I came in to pick up my order and signed my receipt and the woman leaned in and said to me in Korean, ""Nowadays people even tip for takeout orders."" I added 16% tip and revised my total where she then took the signed receipt and walked away without so much as a thank you. You can call me the jerk but gratuity should be added for good service. I'm not expecting to have the red carpet rolled out and being bowed to upon my arrival but to only acknowledge that we're the same people to demand more money from me is deeply offensive. Also, update your website's menu so people know you're not serving Korean-style chicken wings instead of just the homepage saying you're open for dine-in. How hard is that?

I hear there's another Korean restaurant nearby called Maru. I'm looking forward to ordering from them instead.",49,
Jessi S.,09/02/22,1,,2,4,"Food was wonderful! Lost a star for service because we felt rushed and 1 persons entree came out with appetizers while us other two received ours after she was done eating. Would definitely recommend making reservations since it was busy even on a Tuesday. The chicken wings were tender and juicy and the kimchi pancake was tasty with the sauce. I enjoyed my pork belly bbq platter, but the bossam was the real winner with thicker cuts of pork belly. Also had a bite of the dak galbi which was flavorful, good chicken, but very spicy!",437,386
Sarah G.,29/03/22,,,1,4,"I came here when visiting a pal recently and I have to say, the service was absolutely stellar. Everyone working here is amazing, kind and so great at their job!

Farah C.,27/06/22,1,,,5,"Doma is my favorite Korean restaurant in town! Their vegan/veg options are clearly labelled and it's easy to modify most dishes to make them veg if they aren't already. My partner and I dined in one time but have since gotten take out on a bimonthly basis. The restaurant is usually pretty packed in the evenings on weekends and is a cute date spot.

The takeout is always phenomenal. We always get the tteokbokki (because it is consistently delicious) and another entree and one appetizer/small dish. They make the rice cakes fresh so you definitely need to finish them in one sitting since they don't save well. Even the kimchi pancakes stay crispy and fresh in the takeout container. The veg udon is another favorite of ours, but we also occasionally get the bibimbap or japchae. Now I'm just waiting for a veg soondubu option. 

The mandu were okay but I personally don't like fried dumplings, but my partner really enjoyed them. The prices are fair for the portions and each dish has just the right amount of spice. I'm always full by the end of the meal but never feel gross or heavy. The tofu is not fried, rather steamed or braised in most dishes, which I prefer! 

Doma will be our go-to as long as I'm in Cville.",23,369
Ivan C.,28/06/22,,,2,4,"After moving to the area, we wanted some Korean food and we were ecstatic to see one nearby and offered to-go orders. So here is my review!
Food: B+
We had the pork belly, bibimbap and seafood pancakes, which were solid. The amount of seafood they put in the pajun (pancakes) was more than we imagined and more than offered when we had it in CA. The pork was cooked well and chewy and tender at the same time. The only thing about the pork dish was its saltiness. It was a tad bit too salty for our tastes, but otherwise everything came out well and by the time we got home, was still warm.

Staff: A
Staff was cordial and really nice. Definitely made us feel at home despite only being there for a to-go order.

Parking: A- 
Really had no issues with parking nearby and was able to get in and out in no time.

Vibe: B+
The inside was cozy, and had solid seating arrangements. Wish we could have ate there, but that will be for next time.

Overall: B+
We will definitely order here again and hope to sit-down for our next Korean meal!",489,50

Nancy H.,11/09/22,,,,5,I've gone to Doma a couple of times before and I've enjoyed my meal each time! It's great for Korean food in Charlottesville and the vibe is a great place to catch up with a friend or a date night. I got the tteokbokki with ramyun this time and thought it was delicious. I did wish I had more fish cakes because I only had one piece and was looking forward to more. The rice cakes were a great texture and the ramyun was also bouncy and not soggy. I've tried their dolsot bibimbap and soondubu jjigae before and thought they were tasty as well. The staff is also incredibly polite and attentive. Doma has become one of my go to dinner spots in Charlottesville as a UVA student.,201,33
Emily L.,11/09/22,,,3,4,"Mandu Dumplings: 
Can't go wrong with dumplings. The dumplings were crispy and packed with flavor on the inside. I enjoyed the dipping sauce (reminded me of the sauce they use for the pancakes), but could definitely go for more spice. 

Dolsot Bibimbap: 
I was craving bibimbap and needed to satisfy my desire for a steaming, wholesome bowl of meat, veggies, and rice. My favorite part of the dish is getting to eat the crispy rice at the bottom. The portion was generous and came with a side of banchan (pickled radish, broccoli, kimchi, soup). 

Dak Galbi: 
It was my first time trying this dish and I was pleasantly surprised. I absolutely loved the sweet potato - it was a pop of flavor and texture that contrasted with the spice. The sauce itself was pretty spicy I guess (I didn't really mind it) so I would take note of that if you decide to order this (it has three js on the menu?). I wish there was more meat because there was a larger ratio of the onions and scallions. 

Went to Doma on a whim and luckily got a table for two. Doma is always busy, so I'm surprised we got a table so fast. The service was kinda slow to take our order and provide us with water, but other than I have no complaints. The interior of the restaurant was warm and bright, and I liked how the kitchen was open so you could see the cooks preparing the dishes. Coming from Northern Virginia, I've definitely had better Korean food, but I think Doma is the best here in Charlottesville. Overall, I had a great experience here and would return soon!",41,34

Andrew N.,24/02/23,,,1,4,"DOMA is a great Korean restaurant just in between the Corner and the Downtown Mall. They have an extensive menu full of Korean cuisine staples. My friend and I went during a Friday night and had no issues getting a seat in a packed restaurant. I ordered the Dolsot Bibimbap with beef ($16.50), and my friend ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice ($13.50).

The Dolsot Bibimbap was delicious coming from a smoky, hot bowl that continued to sear the rice, veggies, and meat inside of it. It came with a spicy gochujang sauce that was a MUST HAVE for this dish. The rice bowl was tasty but honestly needed more of that sauce as it meshes the entire dish together. The taste was lacking in savoriness and continued to taste the same despite each unique bite you would take from all of the ingredients in the bowl. The experience, however, is amazing as you eat from a bowl that keeps your food hot FOREVER (the WOW factor)!

Overall, DOMA is THE place to go to for Korean food in Charlottesville. I'm still eyeing some other Korean restaurants around town, but I've been here multiple times, and it always hits the spot for anyone trying to find good Asian food. A must try in Charlottesville!",61,1
Janelle T.,26/02/23,,,,4,"We were in Charlottesville for a concert and love Korean food... so decided to try DOMA. 

Atmosphere was super inviting and clean. We were seating right away when arriving at 5:15 on a Friday. Service was ok... took a bit to get our order in but once it was in food came out super quickly. One draw back... every time someone walked behind my chair the floor shook and that meant the table did too. 

Now onto food. Decided to try some things we've never seen at other Korean restaurants.  Starters were TTEOK GALBI - just ok, the chicken meatball had very little flavor unfortunately. MANDU my teen said we're the only thing she would get again. We got   TEOKKOCHI with soy garlic and they really needed more sauce. KIMMARI were ok but could have been better if rice noodles weren't mushy, dipping sauce was great.  We then shared the beef DOMA KOREAN BBQ PLATE and it was ok. Meat pieces were very small but good flavor. My teen said it felt a bit dry. 

I would maybe give it a second attempt but try other things, maybe something with some spice.",158,45

The decorations were very homey and cozy. The food was the star, each dish had a lot of flavor and the portion sizes didn't skimp. The restaurant was busy so you could tell it's popular! 

Tip: if you get rice in a stone pot, I would suggest to mix the bowl once in a while. Since the stone pot is so hot, it stays hot for a while and will continue cooking the food and rice so the rice may get over cooked and hard.",23,4
Kiley W.,22/09/23,,,,4,"It's expensive for the portion sizes, but tasty. I like the sweet potato tempura and the udon. It's very flavorful compared to a lot of other stir fried udons I've had without being just the flavor of red pepper. I do feel like it's gotten less spicy since they first opened.",56,4
Jeff N.,26/09/23,,,,5,"I didn't expect a lot due to the location but I was way wrong!

Kimchi pancakes were amazing.

Clean, friendly and fair priced.

Will come here every time I visit this city.",2,1
Macie T.,16/10/23,,,,5,"My group of 4 arrived 15 minutes before they opened and they were sweet enough to let us wait for service inside the building to avoid the rain! The ambiance was as good as their service too. 

The food was very good, we ate the bibimbap with the sauce from the tteokbokki and it was delicious. The corn cheese was a yummy appetizer. My friends who ate with me also enjoyed their food. I would definitely come back here again to try the rest of their menu!!",8,
Zia Z.,29/10/23,,,,5,"Great food, quality and service! Our go to for local Korean. They always get it SPICY like I like it. Love the udon, bulgogi and bimbimbap. It's nice to dine in too, cute quaint spot. Park in the back or street parking.",40,
Meghan S.,02/11/23,,,,5,"my go-to spot in charlottesville. nice atmosphere and most importantly, DELICIOUS food.",33,325
Derek L.,04/11/23,1,,,4,"Expected a bit more from how hyped up I heard this place was. Ordered the pork belly and beef barbecue plate. Maybe it's a method of cooking I'm not too familiar with, but both dishes were leaning on the dry side and was especially more noticeable with the pork belly. Other than that, both dishes were good. The ssam is a must dip with the meat. It's got a kick to it but compliments the meats very well.",30,
Lulu P.,02/12/23,,,,4,Doma has great food and it's not expensive. We love the wings! I also love the atmosphere especially when they dim the lights. Too many restaurants in town love to turn the lights up bright like a cafeteria which totally spoils the experience.,42,1
Rex H.,11/12/23,,,,5,After being in S Korea for 1 year work assignment I could not tell I was in Charlottesville Va. stop by and enjoy the food,25,
Mathew F.,25/12/23,,,,3,Food is solid.  Service was poor the second time we went.  Hot soup was poured on my wife and she received a sorry with a napkin.,5,
S Cassandra F.,03/03/24,,,,5,"Such good food. Whether it's Bimibap or the Korean bbq (go team beef!) I've never eaten anything bad here. The kimchi is bloody gorgeous. I may have, over time, eaten most of the appetizers and they're all solid. The Kimchi pancakes are deceptively good. The sauce for the dumplings is also crazy amazing. I have only ever done take out or delivery, but these folks always have my order ready promptly ... just imagine getting of Amtrak and then having the best meal you can imagine. That is Doma !!",38,
Emma E.,17/03/24,,,,3,"The food here is pretty solid, the service was kinda slow and could use a little work. Ambiance is cute inside and overall it's a decent spot for Korean food in cville.

We had the fruit slushees and they were all decent. For entrees I had the kimchi jjigae soup and it was solid. Not the best I've had but spicy and still pretty good. Portion sizes and prices are all decent here.

I'd come back again.",249,18
Genevieve B.,01/04/24,,,,5,"Delicious! 

Have been twice now, loved it both times! Food is SO GOOD and the waitstaff are adorably helpful.",9,
M L.,14/04/24,,,,5,"Always have a great experience here. Service is prompt, food is delicious and is the most authentic I've found for Charlottesville.",93,28
Camryn K.,10/05/24,,,,5,"This is a great place to get Korean food in the Charlottesville area! I have both eaten in the restaurant and ordered takeout from here, and the food has been consistently good. The service was good, and I thought the restaurant was super nice and pretty spacious.

I usually order the barbecue plate with spicy pork, and I love the sides that come with it (like the kimchi and pickled radish), but I wish they gave more of them. The spicy pork has very good flavor, and it goes well with the ssam dip. I thought it was well cooked as well. 

This is one of the places I have consistently returned to in Charlottesville, and I would recommend it if you are looking for solid Korean food!",122,3
Samina M.,18/05/24,,,,5,"Doma is a UVA/Charlottesville stable! Having eaten here for almost 3 years now, I have never had a bad experience here.

My personal favorites have always been the Kimchi Fried Rice with Chicken and Cheese, Tteokbokki, and the various flavors of wings. Not to mention the various Soju flavors they have paired excellent with the dishes!

On this visit, I've tried the Korean BBQ Plate with beef and banchan including kimchi, onions, and soup. Delicious, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The meat was tender and not too salty. Highly recommend!

The restaurant is clean and has such a friendly, helpful staff. Always so welcoming and ensure you get exactly what you came for!

Be sure to check out Doma next time you are in Cville!",166,29
N D.,26/05/24,,,,5,"First time here and the ambiance was welcoming. The service was outstanding, friendly and prompt. And the best part is the food was great. The wings were cooked to perfection, and the sweet potato appetizer was delicious. Will definitely be back.",16,
Jim L.,08/06/24,,,,3,This place has alright food for a decent price. I guess if you want Korean food around the area your options are limited. I didn't like the fact that they were being cheap with banchan and they were also not good either. Kimchi was alright and the pancakes were doughy. I would just drive to DC for some Korean food at this point ‍,250,250
B M.,16/06/24,,,,3,"Mediocre at best. Food was just ok, not super flavorful. More of an assembly line feel, it was cooked but not hot when it got to us. Staff was friendly but not super attentive. Location is good, right along the strip. Probably wouldn't come back since there are other options in town.",223,1
Christina C.,07/07/24,,,,5,Delicious food and great value with appropriate portion sizes. One of the tastiest places we ate in the area and complete surprise,40,33
Grace K.,26/08/24,,,,4,"Food - 4, Service and Ambiance - n/a as we did take out.

I got the Doma Bokum Udon with seafood.  It was fine.  I thought some of the seafood was tough (the squid in particular) and the shrimp was a little mushy, and I felt it could have been flavored better (more garlic?).  The udon part was fine, and I like the vegetables in it, but felt the sauce was not flavorful enough for my liking.  I got the Doma sweet soy sauce flavoring, and while yes it was sweet, it wasn't overly sweet (a good thing), but it just lacked umph in the flavor profile.  Seemed one dimensional.  Could have used a little more salt, and a hint of a spice (just a sprinkle of gochugaru?) to give it more dimension.  It was good enough, so I give it a 4, but it wasn't anything to rave about.  I had a bite of the pork belly as well and thought it was a little tough and again felt like it could have been more flavorful (more garlic).",136,5
Renata L.,31/08/24,,,,5,"Even before moving to Charlottesville, I was looking for a Korean restaurant since I love the food! Heard that Doma was the best and I was finally able to try it!! I ordered a lot of different foods and I'm obsessed!! The Toppoki is amazing, loved the kimmari, bibimbap! Everything! I'm sure I'm going to back!",4,
Conor G.,21/10/24,,,,1,"""Very disappointing experience. The food was bland, and the service was incredibly slow. We waited far too long for cold food, and the staff didn't seem to care. Won't be coming back.""",8,
Jane E.,24/10/24,,,,2,"Ordered Bibimbap, received room temperature food in a cold bowl. Very disappointed. I was expecting a hot stone pot.  Apparently I was supposed to specify that I wanted it in a hot stone pot.",43,19
Lynn W.,09/12/24,,,,3,"This is not how Korean food is supposed to be. I am Korean. I had a Korean restaurant and was quite successful. Flavors were off, maybe it was all ""Americanized"". I get thats a thing for a lot of cultural foods to adapt to others tastes, but, no.. Maybe its just Charlottesville, but for taste, I'll continue to cook at home. I suppose if your being lazy its not bad. I think the real crime is there wasnt any other choice around for Korean food when I was visiting. But personally, ive had better shopping at HMart in Northern VA & Maryland. 

I rank my decisions to eat somewhere again as:

1 star - if someone else buys it I won't eat it, I would rather go hungry.
2 star - if I'm hungry, no other options are open and someone buys it - I would consider eating it
3 star - I'm ok with eating it as long as someone else pays
4 star - I will eat again and pay for it and be a semi-regular customer
5 star - I will travel for good food and pay good money and be back on a regular basis and maybe even pay for yours just so we can go",51,43
