1,,"Anna Y.","2008-06-12 18:51:00",1,2,2,1,1,"Eh?

I went to college in Charlottesville, VA.  Now, we like to eat down in cville.  I was back in town for a wedding and the rehearsal dinner was there.  
Let me start with the good stuff.  
-Service: They have good service.  They cleared plates and filled drinks fast. They were attentive but not overly hovering.  We had a big group of people but the food came out fairly quick. 
-Cost: Eh.   a little more pricier than most. But, not bad. I'm not sure how much the food actually lives up the place though.

Oh.. wait i'm already going into the bad stuff:
-Food: Dude, seriously the most important thing.  I ordered... Piccata di Pollo con Limone.. aka. Chicken Piccata. It comes with spaghetti in a similar sauce. Honestly, the chicken part of the dish was really good. However... God, I hate spaghetti.  It tasted like plain spaghetti.   Vitello alla Parmigiana  aka Veal Parmagean.... ditto. meat good. bad pasta.  

The salads were okay. You really have to be stupid to mess up salad. 
The ice-cream dessert was okay. Ditto on the stupid thing.
The appetizers... calamari was good. Not overly greasy.  And the bruschetta appetizer was pretty good as well.  

I feel... they fall short.  They have a decent atmosphere... you can watch movies outside and eat dinner, good tablescape and dishes, etc.  The bathroom was so hot, I don't know why they don't have ac in there.  

But, yes.. back to the food. I feel like I'm avoiding it.  

Here's the gist:

If you are a poor college student or your car breaks down in front of the restaurant... then you can go.  If not... go anywhere else. Go downtown ... it's only a few minutes away.  Honestly... I'm a little unimpressed.  apathetic, really.... kind of place where you don't take the leftovers home, but leave it there. 

Sorry, Vivace, better luck next time. 
I change my rating to a 1.",491,70,EeNtI6eAs5yBP4MLYfJvgA,"Fairfax, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EeNtI6eAs5yBP4MLYfJvgA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Nq-qJebFlefHGDfnX-J28A/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vivace-charlottesville?hrid=

I have always had good service at Vivace and good food to boot.  Because of my food allergies I am unable to eat most Italian food but they've been able to tweak the menu to allow me to dine and the food has always been excellent.  The drink menu is expansive and they have a lot of really nice wines.  

Vivace is a little off the beaten path if you're used to dining in the downtown area, like I am, but that makes it nice because it actually has parking!  They tend to fill up on the weekends so be sure to call ahead and make a reservation if you're going in on a Friday or Saturday evening.",693,572,MPiLBHXnUiWvTQRuh36TOQ,"Pass Christian, MS",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=MPiLBHXnUiWvTQRuh36TOQ,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Qw3Z__uh4T5rLpQ9dSkYxw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vivace-charlottesville?hrid=

This has happened about 3-4 times now. They have some people working here with the worst attitude and have no problems being plain rude to you on your face. They advertise that they offer take out orders but have no patience to take down the takeout order and talk to you like you are not welcome there.

This one night my wife was trying to order a takeout from this place and the gentleman who answered the phone basically said to her in the middle of the conversation ""Ma'am, you are really trying me tonight!"". All because my wife asked to add some pesto sauce to their pasta primavera. My wife had to cancel the order because he was not interested to take the order at all, and he was very OK with it. 

The first couple times we gave the benefit of the doubt to them thinking that they might be busy, but after this time we are pretty much done here. Way to lose your regular customers!

The artichoke dip was served piping hot and was quite tasty if a little too salty for my taste. Our entrees were served in massive portions and we were only able to eat half of our respective dishes.

We have done taken out from Vivace several times during Covid, and visited a couple of months ago and ate outside. This time we decided to eat inside and everything was great. Recognized our reservation, sat us immediately, and the service was all that you would expect and require.  Food was excellent and the timing of appetizers and the meal was good, especially since we knew that it is important for them to turn tables since we are still at 50% capacity.  

Only negative is parking.  I had to circle twice before I parked in a really tight spot on a hill.  On one side UVA is putting up a new building so there is a chain link fence that limits parking, and on the other side there is a strip of stores and since it was a Sunday we thought we could park in the empty lot. However, they had a part-time security guard who politely told us this was off-limits. Seems the ownership of the strip mall is not very supportive of Vivace.

The gnocchi was solid but not excellent, the spinach cream sauce was a very liquid-y cream sauce with some cooked spinach in it. The carbonara had the same problem of very liquid-y sauce.

The staff was not particularly kind to us when we entered, we asked for a table for three and the staff asked us to wait a moment (which is more than fine), and while we waited they talked amongst themselves. We tried a few times to ask quick questions and were ignored and eventually told to seat ourselves.

It was so delicious, full of umami and the serving was quite large. The sauce filled up the little pockets in the pasta and the ratio of sauce to carb, was perfect for me.

I think I've found one of my new favorite places, so thank you so much for the recommendation! The food was delicious and well priced. Not overly expensive for a nice meal, great ingredients and the service was really good, our waitress was knowledgeable and really made a positive difference.

We sat on the upper patio, but next time we go, we will request the bistro seating which is outdoors and near a large willow tree. I recommend you ask for the table under the willow tree if you have enough time to make a reservation!

I am new to Cville, and Vivace had been my favorite place in the few weeks I have lived here. Tonight, I went after work, after a very long day, looking for good comfort Italian food. I was so looking forward to a relaxing, delicious meal. So, there was no question where I was heading tonight. Vivace! From the moment I sat down, however, the service was pathetic. The servers brought me bread and olive oil -- but no plate on which to eat it. My salad was delicious -- but no one came to clear my plate, even as I watched a nearby table of five being treated like royalty. I waved my hand for five minutes to get someone to take my dinner order. Finally, dinner came, and it was delicious. But I sat there afterward for 25 minutes with no one to refresh my water, take my accumulating plates or to give me my check! I My Uber arrived 15 minutes after I had finished my meal -- but NO CHECK. I was tempted to leave without paying but knew that was not right, so I took my credit card to the cashier and asked if I could pls pay before my Uber drover away. The server took my card, came out with a receipt, but not ONE WORD of apology. I felt angry and asked to see a manager...and then felt even angrier. I interrupted a conversation the owner was having at the bar, and apparently he was too enthralled to be concerned with the issues of an older woman at who had just spent $50 at his restaurant. When I mentioned to him what had happened, he said he already had spoken to the server. But again, not one apologetic word! As a business woman, I travel frequently, and it is not unusual at all for me to dine alone. In most cities and in most places, I am treated with courtesy because I am spending money at dining establishments. Vivace, however, acted like I was invisible. An older women dining alone -- who is she, anyway? The owner's attitude was even more disagreeable than the server's -- he could have at least apologized. Because he did not, I will not be back. I do not do business with people who do not treat people with courtesy -- especially when we are paying for it.  It is sexist and ageist to treat a paying female customer with such discourtesy. I felt like I was living in the 1800s. A simple ""I'm sorry"" was all it would have taken make the night right. That that did not happen signifies a disrespect and disdain for older women and demonstrates to me that this place is, sadly, a throwback to previous generations when such disrespect and hostility were mainstream.

After several years of living in Charlottesville, I finally took a trip over to the famed Vivace. I had heard so much about this apparent staple of Charlottesville Italian food and I had put off trying this restaurant due to not having a ""valid enough"" reason for visiting the restaurant. My sister's graduation celebration demanded a visit, so I finally had an opportunity to visit it. 

Walking up to Vivace, it becomes apparent that the outdoor section of the restaurant is gorgeous; especially at night. The string lights and ambience alongside the UVA road is alluring, and had it not been the wintertime, I might have requested an outdoor table. They have heaters in appropriate places, so if you want to eat outside, it's still a realistic possibility. After being seated in an upstairs dining room that flooded my nostrils with nostalgia of my grandparents' attic, we were greeted by a nice waiter named Landry. This brings me to the best part of the meal: the service. Landry and the other servers were enthusiastic, knowledgeable about the food and drink options, and attentive almost to a fault! When you needed a drink refill, you got a drink refill. When you needed more fresh bread, you got fresh bread. 

Our appetizer was bruschetta. The dish was nicely complemented with fresh tomatoes and unrealistically delicious balsamic vinegar. A great start to a great evening. After our orders were placed, our experience soured. We waited for a minimum of 45 minutes for our food to be served. My friend pointed out that it had been at least an hour and that a party of 6 (2 less than our group) received their food and their bill even though they had arrived 15 minutes after us. Sure, the food had probably been made to order, but a 45-60 minute wait for food is an incredibly long amount of time. 

Eventually, the food came to the table. I received the Spaghetti and Meatballs; an Italian classic. The marinara sauce was uninspired. I tasted the food of my other family members. The food ranged from bland to pretty darn good. It's not bad, but there's certainly better Italian food in Charlottesville.

So would I revisit Vivace? If I had a friend ask me to join them in celebration at Vivace, the understandable prices, fantastic service, and decent decor wouldn't keep me from coming.

It was a nice atmosphere.
  We started with the fried oyster appetizer which was on the specials menu. They were delicious! Very fresh with an excellent aoli alongside. Frankly the best we have had all year. The portion was very generous. 
  Next the wedge salad. Again delicious! The gorgonzola and pancetta were a perfect match.
  My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs which he said he enjoyed. I ordered the mussels with homemade tagliatelle pasta. Not something I normally order, but the fried oysters were so good I decided to keep with the seafood theme. The portion was huge with a generous amount of mussels. They were as fresh as the oysters. The tagliatelle was cooked perfectly. The sauce was just enough to allow the flavor of the mussels to shine. I brought most of my entree home, being full by then, and look forward to finishing it tonight!

Management made no offer or effort to return my card. The next day when I came back into town to pick up my card, they did not say, ""We are sorry for the inconvenience"" or anything similar. They asked me for my ID, and gave me back my card.
My gripe is the indifference that management showed me to my situation. Clearly, they have enough customers so they did not feel compelled to offer to help me or at minimum apologize for making me drive 56 miles roundtrip for their mistake. There are other restaurants in Charlottesville that are more customer-oriented that I will patronize in the future.

I was then given the correct entree but it was not good. It was like a bowl of creamy pesto sauce with pasta hidden beneath. I didn't complain because it was edible, just not what I expected.

101,,"Emma E.","2024-06-26 19:44:21",0,0,0,0,2,"Yeah vivace has kinda fallen downhill since the last time I was in and I probably wouldn't be back at this point. All of my coworkers and friends agree. It was good a few years ago but is nowhere near what it used to be. TLDR: expect really basic kinda boring Italian food for twice as much as you should pay.

First thing is the ambiance in here is great - the building is really cool and the decor inside is great. They have started storing extra kitchen boxes in the foyer, which was a little weird, but overall the ambiance is nice. This is probably the best part of the experience here.

Service wise, not so great. Most of the staff I saw were either high schoolers or early college and act aloof like they're too good to talk to you or act bothered that they have to do their job. Their foyer is basically an intersection with a ton of other paths and the servers/staff will literally run into you while you're waiting at the host stand. Overall really rude. Staff was also walking around in pairs/groups chatting and it felt like I was eating in a cliquey high school cafeteria lol. Top it off with our rude server who joked that he had to check IDs because we ""look like a bunch of babies in a trench coat"" (were all in our mid-late twenties) and then continued to just make backhanded jokes to us the rest of the evening? Yeah. Not great.

Then there's the food. The arancini we got was actually pretty solid. The entrees were not. My ravioli was bland at best, pretty much plain cheese ravioli with vodka sauce. My boyfriends chicken picatta was so boring. Plain breaded chicken with plain spaghetti in what tasted like just straight lemon juice. Ugh

Everyone else at our table said the fettuccini Alfredo and the pasta primavera were similarly boring and bland. This place used to be good but is now a robbery. They are audacious charging as much as they do for some of the most boring Italian I've ever had.

Overall with the combination of our awful service and terrible food we would not be back. Would not recommend you give it a try.

104,,"Tayler N.","2024-07-22 01:54:55",0,0,0,0,1,"I want to, first, make it very clear that our server, Linda, and every waiter/waitress we interacted with was fantastic. Almost every server that walked by took the time to stop and say hello to my well behaved golden retriever, Oatmeal. He was barking a tad at first, but a very nice blonde waitress came over and told us it was not an issue. Ever since the first time I visited, I loved Vivace (I even wrote a very positive review, see attached photos for proof); unfortunately, today I had a very negative experience and will no longer be a loyal customer nor will I ever recommend it as a place to visit again. We had a 6:30 reservation for two and a dog on the patio. We even noted in the reservation that our party included a dog. Oatmeal has sat on their patio multiple times without an issue, and tonight should have been no different. We ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees, yet after sitting on the patio for about two hours a new group of guests chose to sit on the patio. We were sitting right by the entrance to the patio and the front door, meaning that any guest requesting to sit on the patio very clearly knew there was a dog on the patio. Oatmeal was well behaved, and left all other guests completely alone, except for when they would come up and ask to pet him. The problem is, and the part that makes me feel incredibly disrespected, that management approached us halfway through our entrees and told us that they had recieved complaints about my dog. Now, if my dog had behaved in any way problematically I would have agreed and left without a problem. My dog did not go up to other tables, nor did he try and steal any food that was not our own. When I was obviously taken aback by this statement I asked the manager to expand on what exactly was done wrong, and I was informed that ""maybe his tail is hitting people's chairs"", yet the flaw in this was that the only table anywhere near us was completely empty. Very clearly, the newer table was more ""valuable"" than us because my dog was nowhere near them, and even though we were there first and had reserved a table for the dog they just wanted to appease them regardless of how it affected us which was not a fair solution to the problem. I am absolutely disgusted with the way management chose to prioritize them over us, and I am heart broken that I can no longer go to one of my favorite restraunts in Charlottesville because of they way they handled the situation. I proceeded to ask the manager if we were being kicked out, and after dancing around the question for a few seconds it was evident that he expected us to leave, again even though we had reserved the table with the stipulation of having a dog; furthermore, we kept the dog in control and well behaved the entire time. My dog did absolutely nothing wrong, and I am confident that the new table chose to sit on the patio with the intention of kicking the dog out for whatever reason, believing they are more important and more worthy than us. We sat on the patio for two hours, and did not get to actually enjoy our entrees. I think a very clear solution would have been to offer them an inside table if they did not want to be on the same patio as a dog. I am very disappointed that what was supposed to be a fun night at a nice restraunt ended with me leaving early and in tears. Again, Linda was lovely and took very good care of us. If the dog had truly been a valid problem, I have a hard time believing that we would have been able to sit on the patio for about two hours before anyone had to say anything about the dog's behavior to us.",1,0,WiJ8Q2nH-8YrHnPgo3jZGw,"Charlottesville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WiJ8Q2nH-8YrHnPgo3jZGw,,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vivace-charlottesville?hrid=

The struggles that the Italian people went through over the last few hundred years. And who knows who is Italian or not half the people in Richmond Virginia that people think are black or actually Cherokee Indian but that's neither here nor there there's so many critics that shouldn't be critics because first you shouldn't be allowed to judge food with a condescending tone about any of the aspects of it unless you yourself can replicate it at at least the level that you are criticizing or better, it takes a lifetime just about to be able to do that and I'm not talking about eating at Olive Garden A lot of these things seem like personal stabs at the business for something that oh gosh, I could only imagine I've been a line Cook sous chef for the better part of my life and their food is top-notch. It's in black-and-white on the menu. The portions were awesome and I like to eat a lot, and from the looks of the parking lot when I pulled in full of nothing but Aldi's and Porsches and a lot of other high-end vehicles that were the guest patron the place I'd say that there were some pretty experienced pallets there and I almost felt out of place in my Audi A5 Quattro picking up some pasta dishes and some desserts, but I was greeted with kindness may have took a little bit longer than I expected, but that's my expectation not the flow of the business and of course the people were probably young adults because that is one of the better jobs for them to get to give them some real world experience interacting with the public on many different levels the only way for a server to do exactly what the patron would like is a for them to act like a complete and total asshole at the beginning of the dinner by giving the waiter or waitress ridiculous instructions to follow the entire time they're at the table they have to be able to read your mind so cut them some slackbecause if something happens somewhere, it's usually never the waiters or waitresses fault unless they forget something or they're very unattended and that is the learning experience of that job I mean for crying out loud they get paid 213 an hour which barely covers their taxes. I challenge anybody to take on a 12 burner sauté a broiler oven a four-door refrigerator reach under 16 item sauté station bottom themselves. oh with a broiler and two sets of small grill racks for, different fish and what not and you have no time left go so mad respect to those who do that job because I know what it's like while you have condescending pretentious, entitled individuals overlooking the experience and only attacking what they are seeking if you like Italian food, even Gordon Ramsay palette would it would keep his mouth shut.

The food is very good but not mind blowing. Last time I went the spaghetti and meatballs was a bit underwhelming. Every other dish I have gotten here has been quite tasty though. Would recommend the Taste of Italy and Carbonara.

Ambiance is that or a fine dining place without the usual fireworks you get at a place like that (and price tag). 

I would highly recommend giving this place a shot.",140,24,h8I9_Ps0XQo7j7nAVZuamA,"VA, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=h8I9_Ps0XQo7j7nAVZuamA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/BtQMqe3MbSeFXn4731Hdjw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vivace-charlottesville?hrid=
