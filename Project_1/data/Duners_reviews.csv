1,,Karen M.,29/08/08,,,,5,"Love this restaurant.  The menu changes in little ways each day so check out what they have to offer on their website and find a day that sounds especially good to you.  If you notice something that repeats often with minor changes - it's probably delicious, if it's something new on the menu that you don't see on the rotation - it could be hit or miss but it'll probably be a hit.  

The parmesan or herb crusted lamb are always great choices for the rib eye and the cheesecake I had from there was amazing.  

No reservations but if you get there a little early on a weekday, you shouldn't have too many problems.  Also, although the menu looks intimidating and fancy, it really is a casual restaurant.",13,,view review
2,,Dominic L.,26/03/09,,1,2,5,"A daily menu with lots of choices!  Food was great!  One of the best restaurants around.  The second 5 star I have ever given to restaurants around Cville..Would definitely come back and visit again...

Came here after snowboarding at wintergreen... was a little bit under dress.... most people are dressed casual...but the atmosphere and food would ask for more...

They dont take reservations... so be prepared to wait during peak hours... but its definitely worth the drive and wait...",38,1,view review
3,,Tosh K.,05/06/09,,,,5,"Fabulous!  I love this place - fantastic food with beautiful presentation.  We had the mussels and fried oysters to start followed by the soft shell crab and flank steak.  The mussels were the best part and are some of the best I've had.  

The wine list is pretty extensive and has a nice selection as well.

The best part is its location and interior.  For the price one would expect a much more formal setting, but the restaurant is quite casual and makes for much more relaxing experience.",228,3,view review
4,,Scott S.,11/08/09,2,,1,5,"This was a hard decision between 4 and 5 stars. It wasn't perfect... but if I'm honest, for the area... this actually is perfect.  

First, the food was dead on.  From the bread, to the salad, to the steak, it was all flavored beautifully and expertly from a true professional... not someone who wanted to make mass-produced comfort food, but someone who wanted to make delicious, complex yet accessible food.  Who can't get on board with that?

The atmosphere was a bit more dingy than i was led to believe from previous reviews.  It looks and feels almost like a diner that spent a few hundred bucks trying to make it look nice within an evening.  Like trying to set up for a dinner party in a rundown shack with only a few hours to prepare.  Reminds me of an episode of I Love Lucy or something.  It works here though, it keeps a casual, comfortable, yet open atmosphere that prepares you for a high-class, freshly prepared meal.  Perfect for Charlottesville.

The drink list is extensive, and the wine list is as well.  The desserts are ok, but nothing too exciting.  

The service is outstanding by the way.  A knock on the place is that while it isn't 'expensive,' it is a bit more than you'd find anywhere else in this area.  Still going to be pricey, but just to summarize the argument, its 100% worth it.

Its a great place, and much much more than you could realistically expect out of such a place.  This place is somewhere you can go to several times a week, or just once and always be satisfied and content.  Its a great place to be.  If you're out in this area, don't bother going anywhere else.",87,13,view review
5,,Mike C.,02/09/09,1,1,3,5,"With Duner's, it's all about the food.  This venerable Ivy restaurant does not boast an elegant dining room.  The casual wait staff does not fawn over or pamper its guests.  And the kitchen abstains from over-the-top trendy creative culinary endeavors.  Instead, Duner's focuses - and delivers - on sourcing outstanding ingredients and skillfully preparing confident, delicious fine dining dishes.  

Open nightly for dinner from 5 'til 10, Duner's consists of a main dining room featuring booths along two walls and four-top tables in the middle.  There's a smaller dining room to the right.  The décor and place settings are somewhat plain and Spartan but its comfortable nonetheless.  

The menu is created daily based upon the kitchen's ingredients and whims of the chef.  It typically consists of nearly a dozen choices of both appetizers ($8 to $9) and entrees ($19 to $26).  Vegetarian and pasta dishes are always offered as well as sandwiches ($11).  

The challenge is choosing among the wonderfully tempting and deliciously composed dishes.  On a recent experience, we struggled mightily to select our meal.  From the appetizers, we narrowed it down to a short-list of choices that included house-made gnocchi, grilled scallops, steamed mussels and tempura soft shell crab.  We decided on the grilled scallops which were served with a basil and lime cream sauce.  

The scallops were expertly prepared: sweet and plump, well seasoned and perfectly cooked to an ideal consistency.  Sadly, too many kitchens destroy this delicate ingredient through overcooking or allowing the just-cooked scallops to sit too long on the plate before being served, resulting in something that's at-best dry or at-worst rubbery.  The dish was served with a sublime sauce whose richness and slight hint of citrus nicely complimented the caramelized, salty outer surface of the scallop.  

The same dilemma faced us for our entrée selections.  In the running were crabcakes, soft shell crabs, snapper and beef tenderloin.  Our waitress offered that the chef excelled at fish, so that helped to slightly narrow it down for us.  My dining companion chose the snapper which was flash-fried whole and beautifully presented surrounded by pepper sambal (or relish).  We tend to grill fish whole, so taking the flesh off the bone was not disconcerting at all.  The fish tasted very fresh and the simplicity of the preparation allowed the ingredient to stand alone.  The relish, was arranged along the circumference of the plate in alternating palettes of red and yellow - a beautiful visual rendering of summer colors.  

I chose the soft shell crabs which were - hands down - the best soft shells I've ever had.  First and foremost, they were incredibly fresh, lacking that ""fishy"" taste one often experiences with soft shells.  That's because it's difficult to get really fresh ones: it requires timing and precision from waterman to processor, distributor and chef.  To be sure, the little devils must be eaten within two days of crawling out of its hard shell.  Duner's sourced these crabs brilliantly.  Not only were the crabs fresh but they were also prepared beautifully.  Expertly flash-fried, still-crisp and, mercifully, not the least bit oily.  The only other place in Charlottesville that has mastered frying at this level of sophistication is Bang! (at least the last time we dined there).  The crabs were served perched upon a warm ""salad"" consisting of potatoes, corn and avocado which was ""dressed"" with a creamy herb and bacon sauce.  The dish had the dichotomic distinction of being both delicate and decadent.  Truly outstanding.        

Duner's offers a nice selection of beer, wine and booze.  A rose, offered by the glass, paired well with our selections and its light hue looked lovely in the glass.  We completed the meal with espresso which was strong but thankfully lacked the obnoxious bitterness of some shots.

Duner's does not accept reservations, so pick the day and time you visit carefully.  Or, stop in, add your name to the list and order a drink at the bar, or wait outside and make friends with others seeking a table.  Dress is casual - you'll see everything from suits and dresses to jeans, shorts golf shirts and sundresses.   

At Duner's the food does the talking.  Bravo!  One of our best meals of the year!",59,5,view review
6,,Graham C.,28/09/09,,,,4,"Very tasty meal. Went intent on getting seafood and they had a fairly wide variety available.

Started out with the butternut squash soup, which was very thick (which is good) and more filling than it appears. Plus, on the cold and rainy day we went, it was very warming. It's topped with crème fraîche and sage which gave it a richer, deeper flavor.

For appetizers we had the mussels and also the scallops. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the ancho & mushroom sauce was spicy without being overwhelming. The mussels, I don't know how you review mussels, except that they didn't give me food poisoning. I try not to look at them too much when I eat them, but I enjoyed the taste.

For the main meal we split the entree of crab cakes, which were awesome. It was like they just took a handful of crab meat, battered it up and fried it. No filler. The mashed potatoes and cole slaw on the side were both nicely done.

And our waitress, in splitting the meal, nicely gave us both full portions of the sides along with our individual crab cake. I thought that was pretty cool, and they didn't charge extra for it.

The potatoes were creamy, no lumps. The cole slaw was finely shredded and not creamy. Just a nice vinegary pepper taste.

Also on the side they give you a scoop of tartar sauce nearly the same size as the crab cake. I don't know who eats that much tartar sauce, but the little bit I had was a-ok.

The salad I could have either done without or had earlier in the meal, but it honestly had no real impact on my enjoyment.

For service, our waitress was very attentive, glasses were refilled often enough without it being intrusive and fresh bread (which was actually fresh baked) was brought without asking and refilled when low.

Overall a very enjoyable experience, which yes is kind of pricey, but I've also spent double that elsewhere for pretty near the same level of quality.",10,,view review
7,,Adam H.,13/10/09,1,,1,4,"Duner's is an interesting place.  It's like going to a big family gathering where everyone pulls out the card tables and gets served an amazing meal.  It's no frills- the atmosphere is white tablecloth but cheap wooden chairs.  You can pony up to the bar on $10 wooden stools.  But the food makes it all worth while.  It's a great menu that includes several fish dishes (grouper, flounder, salmon), pork, duck, lamb and a handful of steak options.  There was also some pasta and a vegetarian dish. All are fairly classic in approach- nothing wacky.  I had the lamb - it was seasoned very nicely and cooked to order.  It was a lot of food- I received 7 ribs in a red wine reduction over a roasted red pepper crepe.  Very nice.  My wife had a beef tenderloin with bleu cheese.  It was rich and decadent.

The reasons for 4 stars and not 5 were really the ambiance and the dessert.  Desserts were a bit lacking.  But overall its probably one of the better meals in the area and I'd go back again.  My tab with one appetizer, 2 glasses of wine, 2 entrees and 2 desserts was about $100 even.  So pretty good value too.

So put it on your list if you're in the area.  And yes, be sure to enjoy the painting behind the bar.",31,15,view review
8,,Beth M.,04/12/10,,,,5,"Hand's down our favorite restaurant in Charlottesville. For around $60 you can have an excellent meal (complete with appetizer, salad, entrees and beverage) which is a great deal considering the superb quality and imagination of the dishes here. Go early though because there will be a wait!",207,28,view review
9,,Deanne R.,01/06/11,1,,4,2,"Everyone's favorite restaurant in Charlottesville is not mine. It is a definite 2, not a 3.

I ordered flank steak and when it was delivered to the table it was luke warm, at best. Anyone who knows me knows I like my hot food HOT - who wants cold beef? The waitress took the plate away and ten minutes later served me a ""new"" dish, which consisted of the same meat, reheated. Not only was I disturbed by this, but the meat was now way overcooked. The flavor was decent, but the chewy factor ruined the dish for me.

What Duner's does do well is their homemade ranch dressing and brussel sprouts - I was impressed with those items. I had heard the bread was amazing, but, truth be told, it was a muted version of some type of Pillsbury dough.

We decided to order dessert - a brownie coffee-ice cream sandwich. I am not sure where they put the coffee flavoring, but where that was lacking there was a cup of chocolate syrup to try to make up for it - it was smothered.

All in I would give Duner's another chance, but my expectations would be much lower. It is likely one of Charlottesville's best restaurants, but I'm not sure that's saying much...",120,347,view review
10,,Joy G.,31/08/12,,1,2,5,"In the middle of my host's vehement discussion on the differences between regular cow and the tragic, glorious Texan longhorn, I looked up from my plate for the first time that evening. Yes I should have been paying more attention but it always feels so weird to be staring at someone whilst chewing, and so I listened with one ear open and the other senses completely fixated on my food. Much like a potbelly pig does. 

Scallops were divine. I had no idea something that came from the butt of a mollusk could taste so good. I've been watching Hell's Kitchen on repeat, and it boggles my mind how badly trained chefs can burn, over-season, under-season, and otherwise mutilate a poor little scallop. I would tell you to just come here and order two plates of the scallops and not to share with anyone, no, not even your children, because they're that delicious. The tomato/mozz plate was your typical kind of yum (with LOCAL tomatoes - so local, they were planted, plucked, and nurtured from someone's backyard). 

I got the grilled hanger steak. Nice to see that it came slightly bloody in the middle. I wish they gave me more roasted potatoes, though, because those micro-roasted tubers were awesome. I think someone asked me if they could have half of one, and I was like ... you can have the skin? I know, I am dreadful. 

Food came fast; wine and water continuously replenished. One thing that did grate a bit on my nerves was that the waitress had no idea of how to gracefully interrupt a conversation with some update on the food. We would be in the middle of something, and she would just lean her head way in and start rambling or stick her arm across someone's plate to reach the wine. Granted, the table we were seated at was a bit awkward to navigate, but she was so obtrusive! Otherwise, a magnificent dining experience.",1420,1602,view review
11,,Mae B.,02/09/12,,,3,3,"I want to love Duner's, I really do. I've been there maybe 10 times in the last 2 years, because it's convenient, and because the very first time I went, I had a pasta dish that knocked my socks off. I've been trying, in vain, to recreate that first magical meal.
Duner's seems to be somewhat hit or miss. The food is never BAD, it just often misses the mark, especially on the main courses. I can't figure out exactly what the problem is, but my dining partner agrees completely. Often it seems like a dish is missing maybe just one ingredient that could have pulled the rest of the dish together, instead leaving you with something that seems like it should be great, but instead came out just ok.

Also, the salad dressings are often pretty poor. Avoid anything that sounds a little more exotic, and stick with ranch or something else basic. I've had a feta-basil dressing and a green goddess dressing that were just awful.

The best things on the menu are the appetizers, which are consistently excellent. The fried panko oysters and the steamed mussels are excellent. The homemade bread is great. Soups are also good--their gumbo is outstanding.

Also, we had a dessert there recently that was out of this world--Warm apple crisp with pecan streusel topping, whipped cream, and vanilla sauce. Best dessert I've ever eaten. Kudos to their pastry chef.

A few other criticisms: they're going to charge the prices they do, they really need to update the interior of the place. The booths are really old, scarred up, and uncomfortable; the flooring is outdated and grungy, and the bar badly needs to be replaced.  At the very least, they need a paint job in there. I hate paying $70 plus dollars for a meal for two in an interior that deserves about $15.  It's also incredibly crowded in there if you sit at a table and not a booth. 
And finally, the service varies wildly. We've had nice waitstaff, and borderline rude waitstaff. In general, it's also slow, so don't go if you're in a hurry.",15,1,view review
12,,Annamaria K.,11/05/14,,,2,5,"We wanted to try this place over 4 years now but always been too hungry to wait for a table for an hour...this time we got there late (8:15pm) we ""only"" waited 25 mins for our table. It worth every second of wait. 

They have a reasonably good wine selection with very reasonable pricing. 

The chicken flatbread was a great appetizer for 3. 

I had the veal sweetbread with caramelized onion and smoked bacon mashed potato  and my date/husband :) ordered the seared salmon. Both entrees were phenomenal!!!

Bottom line, eat a late afternoon snack before you go to hold you over the long wait. But every second of wait worth it! Promise!!!",31,1,view review

15,,Alexandria T.,29/08/15,1,,1,4,"Duner's is a little bit of a drive out of the city down Ivy Road but is a Charlottesville staple. It was highly recommended by several people, so we decided to go there for a nice birthday meal for my boyfriend. It's a pretty cozy place, and the parking lot was full, so I was a bit worried we weren't going to be able to get a table. There was only one available when we walked in, so they were able to seat us right away. Just a note, they do not take reservations.

They have white cloth tables, so it feels like you are dining at a fancy place, but the ambiance created is a little bit off. The tables are pretty close together, and they need better lighting or something. I'm one that goes to a place more for the food than the ambiance, so I was okay with it. They served us warm homemade bread with butter while we were pouring over the menu. There were so many great options and the menu changes daily, so I couldn't plan out what to order ahead of time, and I had a very hard time narrowing down what I wanted!

We ordered a bottle of malbec from Mendoza. The appetizers were the easy part to agree on--we went with fried oysters and fried green tomatoes (a little birthday tradition of ours). The malbec was meh, but the starters were amazing. I loved the aoili that was paired with both dishes, and they complemented each other well. I'm on kind of a fried oyster kick, and these were awesome! Each entree comes with a side salad, and the dressings are all made in house. I went with the Russian and was slightly disappointed by it. For my main, I finally settled on the tuna. I ordered it chef's choice, and it was cooked slightly more than I would have preferred it. It was served over tasso, mushroom, potato, and kalmata olive hash. The hash was such an interesting combination of flavors, and the dish itself was super rich. The dish was done really well, but I couldn't decide if I liked the unique flavors. Now, thinking back to this dish, I actually really, really liked it. My boyfriend ordered the veal scaloppini and was a big fan. 

You should definitely check out Duner's for a nice meal--you can't go wrong here!",755,577,view review
16,,Hugh F.,09/11/15,,,2,2,"If you have two to three hours for dinner, then this is a great place for mediocre food! At least an hour to an hour and a half wait for the main course.

Whatever they were, my expectations were blown out of the water. We ordered the halibut, salmon, trout and vegetarian entrees, and all (including the side) were amazing. Looking forward to returning in the future!

19,,Robin S.,30/08/16,,,,4,My husband and I really enjoyed our meal at Duner's.  The appetizers were very good.  We each ordered our own and we DEFINITELY should have just split one because they are enormous.  Big enough for an entree.  As a result I was a little full by the time my entree arrived.  My husband loved his steak with blue cheese and garlic glaze.  I had the Veal and pasta dish which was good but had a little too much parmesan for my taste.  It made the dish a little gritty.  The service was excellent and accommodating.  We would return.,398,40,view review
20,,Langdon L.,25/11/16,,2,2,4,"After driving by Duners many many times, we finally one night made the trip out so we could end the ritual of pointing and saying we needed to visit as we drove by. 

First impressions were positive of the very quaint building that wasn't fancy but had a clean, dressed up diner feel. I'm still unsure, but it seemed as though some people had reservations even though when I called I was told no reservations were taken. No worries, the bar and the very pleasant bartender was a nice place to wait as we started a bottle of wine. One thing that we both found interesting was that every patron seemed to also be eligible for AARP benefits.... they clearly had a target audience but it made it a much nicer, quiet ambiance. 

The menu was clearly seafood focused, but had a variety for all palates. The fried oysters appetizer was the highlight of the meal! I'm personally a raw oysters fan, but for the GF who isn't they were a good compromise. Our entrees were good, and the wait staff was pleasant. 

Overall I'd say this was a standard, typical dinning experience. It was good food, expected bill of just over $100 before tip (bottle of wine included), but without reservations and the drive out of Cville I don't expect to be back more than a couple times a year. 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to 4 since it's nice to see somewhere focused towards locals and regulars.",160,387,view review

22,,Conan O.,03/03/17,,,,5,"Hardly a month passes without a visit for sit down or take out.

The place has been around forever -- and the latest chef is adding some interesting flavors to the old standards - fair amount of both asian and latin flavors

The menu is more of less the same each night -- crab cakes, Salmon, some white fish, trout, chicken, duck, pork chop, ribeye -- but 3 or 4 times a week the preparation is changed.

Desserts are great and the nightly wine specials are usually a good bet

24,,Rob H.,04/06/17,,,2,5,"Duners was the perfect place to take our large party of seafood lovers, but they also had a mouthwatering choices for the meat lovers. I started with an order of four large grilled scallops in a perfectly spicy mango jalapeño sauce and the BBQ shrimp on spinach pierogis (sounds odd but absolutely delicious!). We also had fresh tuna, rockfish appetizer, delicious crab cakes, and fresh trout, but the star was the Beef Tenderloin with Warm Blue Cheese, smashed  potatoes and a red wine-bacon reduction. PHENOMENAL.  

The service was impeccable and we lacked for absolutely nothing. 

We saved room for dessert!!! 
I had a chocolate dome cake that was moist with mousse layers and a ganache-like shell.  My friend ordered the ""ice cream sandwich,"" - vanilla ice cream with apricot cobbler between brownie crusts. The best was a fresh strawberry shortcake smothered in  strawberries!",679,152,view review

The food is seasonal, great tasting, and generous. While the prices are a bit high, it's reasonable compared to other nice options in Charlottesville. The wait staff is incredibly personable, helpful, and hospitable. 

Some dishes that I recommend are the oyster appetizer, which comes fried golden brown with a great remoulade sauce, the homemade fettuccini with signature Italian sausage in a fragrant tomato creen sauce, the savory, herbed roasted duck, and the veal scallopini. This particular time we also tried the seared scallops with a light orange hoisin sauce, which passed our expectation.

We started with a massive bowl of mussels in a garlic butter wine sauce. The mussels themselves were super fresh and huge. Great appetizer to share.  We also had a few draft beers from Devils BB. 

I had Crispy Fried Whole Flounder with korean bbq dippin sauce over veggie lo-mein.  Talk about unique!  I've never seen a full flounder on a menu.... snapper sure, but not flounder. Overall the dish was awesome and this was perfect. The crispy skin was the best part.  I found the korean bbq sauce to be very salty and acidic and didn't use any of it; however, the dish didnt need any extra sauce/flavor. 

She ordered the seared salmon over spinach and potato gnocchi with prosciutto and corn.  The fish was perfectly cooked, buttery and delicious, Overall the plate was incredibly rich and succulent and she scarfed it down in about 1.5 seconds. Hey, it was her birthday..... 
 
Perhaps the best part was lovely waitress. She share some terrific suggestions/highlights, was super friendly, and in true Duner's laidback fashion she wore a simple t-shirt, apron and jeans.",379,215,view review

With a rotating daily menu, food is prepared based on what's in season, and it's done very well. My husband and I are happy that we decided to come here for a special occasion. 

We shared the calamari which was lightly breaded and came with a ginger wasabi dipping sauce - a pleasant change from typical marinara or aioli sauces. I got the seared salmon, and it was perfectly cooked (not dry at all and with just the right amount of lemon beurre blanc sauce) and was accompanied by housemade gnocchi. My husband had the ribeye which was prepared at the perfect medium rare and upgraded to the special vegetable side of brussel sprouts and spinach.

Overall, deliciously prepared dishes, nice staff, extensive wine list, and lovely but not stuffy ambiance. Definitely one of our new favorite restaurants for special dinners in the area!

I visited on a weeknight about 8:30. So, I didn't have to face the crowd. There was no wait. I still decided to sit at the bar. I started with the Brussels sprouts dish. It's not on the appetizer menu. It's listed as a side at the bottom of the menu. This was the star of the night for me. Most Brussels sprout dishes are roasted and have smoky flavors. Duners' take on Brussel sprouts was a subtlety bold flavor. And I imagine they were braised. It had delicious broth and was cooked with spinach...man so good.  Next, I had a house salad, which comes with the entree, and the house bread. I believe the bread is a sourdough. It was really warm and doughy just like I like my bread. Soooo yummy. The salad was standard fare.  I wished they tossed the salad for you. It would have made it easier to eat (the salad comes with a dollop of the dressing on top of the bed of greens). But once I tossed the salad and cut up the huge leaves, twas delicious!!! I had my salad with the mustard vinegariette. It was perfect. I really had a hard time picking an entree because everything looked delicious. But I went with the tenderloin and potatoes. Really really good choice. The star of that dish to me were actually the onions that accompanied the dish. But I love onions. I topped the night off with the dome cake which is best if you have someone to share it with. It's huge!!!! Totally forgot to take a picture. I said all of that to say Duners is phenomenal and is probably the only place among the top tier restaurants in Charlottesville that I would visit again. It's that good!",339,64,view review

After a long day of visiting near by wineries. I wanted to take her some place nice to get a great meal before we got some rest. This place was nothing short of what I expected. The waitress was very nice. The food was delicious. They could have been a bit more generous on the alcohol with the drunks. Also it's  pretty small dining area but as I stated before very intimate. Those are my only two downfalls about this place. I would definitely visit again if I were in the area. We had a house salad to begin. Shortly after there was calamari for the appetizer. For for entree I had the seared duck and lamb chops for my girlfriend. Topped the night of with a piece of ice cream  fudge cake. The food again was great. I would recommend that you try it.",4,,view review

My husband ordered tuna I had beef brisket. For the serving I don't think my dish was worth $25. It really wasn't any better than the brisket you get at the Nook at half the price.

From start to finish, the food was impeccable. Started the meal with warm bread and butter, always a lovely opening. The fried oysters were so juicy and perfectly seasoned, with a balancing and tasty, tangy aioli. Had seared rockfish with pesto gnocchi, roasted tomatoes and buttered corn purée as my entree.
Seriously, it was to die for. The fish was perfectly cooked and the dish had all the right notes. It was rich and filling, comforting and everything I needed in that moment. Husband had homemade fettuccini with duck meatballs and mushroom spinach cream sauce. Suuuuppppeerrrr delicious. Who knew that duck meatballs could be so perfect? 
Apparently Duner's, and they are doing it right. The atmosphere is comfortable, not stuffy, and the staff are very attentive, a total win-win.

One thing I love is the ambience. The food is delicious which may be unexpected. It's not really near anything. The inside has wooden booths and while you may see someone in a suit you may see someone in a T-shirt and jeans. It's casual and unpretentious. Moreover, the service is fantastic and will make you feel at home. 

I usually get something different each time I come. One thing I have been getting more consistently is the calamari appetizer. It is lightly fried with a delicious sauce. For my entree, I got the gnocchi. I have never gotten the vegetarian dish here and was not disappointed. Add that in with house bread and it made for another great meal.",125,98,view review

The ambiance is a study of contradictions. Some attention could be placed to the facade of this restaurant first off. It doesn't leave you with an impression that there is anything but pancakes and bacon inside. Once inside, it's French country meets local dive. Crisp, white tablecloths and very uncomfortable wooden booths and chairs.. The whole place needs room dampening. It's crazy loud. Service was also a contradiction Our waitperson would leave for long periods of time. Thankfully there was a young man filling water glasses who took supreme care for us. Even ran our credit card.

The food was incredible--the menu was so diverse and had so many tasty options.  We had the mussels which were mind blowing.  We always order mussels on any menu and we agreed that these were probably the best we have ever had overall.  You could drink the delicious broth they are cooked in or just soak the wonderful House made bread in it and eat it like we did.  

They gave us complimentary champagne and pumpkin cheesecake which was totally unnecessary but speaks to the thoughtfulness of this restaurants staff and ownership.  We had another dinner the next day at another respected restaurant and it was such a let down after Duner's.  The wine list here is delicious and fairly priced.  Our entrees were both fresh, great portions, and genuinely delicious.  We both can't wait to come back here again and again.

I am definitely not a high maintenance customer, but our group had a reservation, we were there on time and clearly there to enjoy a meal and spend some money, and we were practically ignored by our server. 
We waited a looong time to order drinks, we had to request water and bread for the table, we waited well over an hour before we got our meals (maybe a busy kitchen -- ok, but the server could have checked in with us/updated us in the interim?) She spent plenty of time chatting with guests at other tables, but did not extend any friendly courtesy to us. (And we are a friendly group!) Generally did not feel welcomed.

The appetizers (fried oysters and stuffed quail) were just okay. 

It was the entrees (duck and veal) however, that were quite disappointing. The duck was sliced too thin and the skin/fat wasn't crisp at all. The breading on the veal was soggy and fell off as soon as you attempted to cut it. Then a arugula salad was plated on top of the hot pasta that came with the veal, leaving it wilted and soggy. 

The desserts (ice cream sandwich and peach cobbler) were also underwhelming. The ice cream was frozen and crystallized. The peach cobbler wasn't warm and was 90 percent biscuit.",7,263,view review

The brussel sprouts were barely boiled so very bitter and inedible.  Not sautéed as described on the menu.  The ""baked"" halibut was equally disappointing.  I think it was steamed, plain, just a wedge of lemon and some overwhelming fig ""gremolata"" (which was essentially just ground figs with some nuts) on top.

The new ownership has not kept to the high standards of not only excellent food but excellent service. I was ""met"" (not greeted) by a inappropriately, (somewhat) dressed hostess who denied us an empty booth stating that if we wished to sit there we would need to leave within an hour. Things became progressively worse after being seated elsewhere to be jabbed by a nail protruding from the chair. Drinks arrived tasting more like water than cocktails. Our appetizer of fried oysters was undercooked; the marinated lamb chops were almost raw and overly seasoned with pepper. My partner's pan-seared tuna entrée was as he called it a B-C grade quality of food. His side of broccoli was over-salted to disguise it's lack of freshness. Gordon Ramsey would lose his mind here. The only saving grace was our waitress Becky who has been a loyal employee of over 20 years. Her professionalism and attention to her customers is outstanding.

You did nothing even though everyone was watching this particularly long table which could have easily been relocated into the tent room.You inflicted this screaming child on over 100 diners each paying $200 or more a cover. When my child acted like that we immediately exited the restaurant because we knew that just the change in temperature calmed them down. And then they could return.

79,,Pierre E.,05/09/22,,,1,3,"Duner's enjoys an excellent reputation and is usually a memorable choice for a dinner out.  However, a recent Sunday experience was less than noteworthy.  I was surprised at how many menu choices were no longer available that day and when you look forward to trying something, its absence dampens your enthusiasm for the meal.  I found the soup a little bland and not particularly creamy; and the mussels were not as fresh as one would hope. The bread was its usual example of excellence. I wondered if some of the remaining menu items were more ""ready to serve"" offerings that can be stored, such as the short rib.  It had some interesting and enjoyable tastes but seemed a little dry for short rib as if it had been cooked hours prior, maybe even frozen and reheated for my meal - a suggestion that was strengthened by the fact a piece of tin foil was attached to the food.  The wine list has improved vastly over the 20 years we have been going to Duner's but don't expect to be served by anyone who knows much about the wine - even the pricier offerings.  Nonetheless, the wine was enjoyed by all as was the meal.  We'll try again another day, but not a Sunday.",100,,view review

My recent experience was the most disappointing 'Fine dining' experience I've ever had. To start, they have completely gutted the bold and broad menu. So many unique dishes have been removed that were a Duner's staple. We started with the fried oysters and they were fine, nothing spectacular but they were good. For my entree we had the halibut and the duck. The Halibut was so dry it was crumbling, the polenta did not taste fresh nor had much flavoring. The duck ($40) and compliments were a complete disappointment. The duck tasted boiled and to top it off it was smothered in a strawberry topping that tasted like jarred smuckers jam. The potatoes were boiled and un-seasoned. To end on a good note our server was fantastic, and has served me before.

I was having a hard time deciding between 5 or 6 dishes! The waiter brought yummy bread and butter and was so professional and nice, but gave a comfortable feel. They have plenty of beers, but only Stella on tap...classy and delicious. We chose shrimp egg rolls as an app, then meatloaf and pan seared ahi tuna as our mains.

The menu is limited in that all the dishes are very similar (also the menu wasn't posted online until about 1/2 hour before the restaurant opened, even though it was pretty much the same menu for past week or more). There weren't any chicken dishes, and only one pasta dish. We opted not to order an appetizer as nothing appealed to us. It took 20 minutes before we were served our first drinks. Also, the seating was so uncomfortable!! Small ladder back chairs with no comfort at all. The atmosphere is a '50's building with homemade touches (which wouldn't be an issue if the food was great, but it was just meh). The staff were lovely and very attentive which is why we are giving two stars. Our meal took an hour apparently due to my pork chop needing time to cook. If we had had an appetizer we wouldn't have minded, but again, the selection wasn't appealing. My husband had a steak. Both my pork chop and his steak were exceedingly tough and his steak was full of gristle. My broccoli and his asparagus were cooked to death. The mashed potatoes were just so-so. Dessert was ok, but again, nothing lived up the legend that this establishment has. Also, the noise level was so loud that my husband and I could not hear one another speak and we were seated at a small table for two.

Our party of 2 started with the bruschetta, which comes as one big piece. It was full of flavor in every bite. I had the crab cakes and substituted the mashed potatoes for French fries. I especially loved dipping the crab cakes and fries in the tartar sauce. Fried crab cakes were good, but I think they would have been better baked or steamed.

Service was fast and friendly. It was a full house on a Wednesday night, so I highly recommend making reservations. Décor here is pretty basic, but great service and food quality. One thing they could improve on is getting some lighting out in the parking lot. It's pitch black on there at night.",1266,4808,view review

89,,Parker H.,20/02/23,2,1,2,3,"Y'all need to listen closely. Diners looks kind of cool and probably has great reviews but it's not like that at all. If you haven't been going here as a regular for more than 3 years it's not worth it. The place is run with regulars that are all retired and love to play gold on the weekends. The food is above average but not good enough to make your day or make you go to bed smiling. The lighting in the restaurant is poor; way too dark. I have no complaints about the wait staff. All in all, I would not recommend this restaurant.",9,2,view review
90,,Amy K.,04/03/23,,,,5,"We had the pleasure of eating here last weekend. It's been on my list of places to try for quite a while but since we live in Delaware we unfortunately had to wait until we were in town again. The restaurant is small, homey and very comfortable. We arrived an hour early for our reservation and planned to sit at the bar. Instead, we were greeted by the NICEST HOSTESS EVER and she sat us at a table right away. I mean it with utmost sincerity that she clearly loves her job and was a joy to watch. We were seated in the bar area so we heard all of her interactions with customers and I was so impressed that I mentioned it to her as we were leaving. Our server, Fletcher, was on point and provided excellent service. The food was spectacular! My fiancé had the New York strip and I had the pan roasted beef tenderloin. Both were prepared perfectly and were mouth watering and delicious. Unfortunately we are only in town a few times a year but I know for a fact we will go back to Duners every trip! Thank you for a lovely evening, Duners!",66,1,view review

98,,Kramer R.,01/07/23,,,,4,"After so many years (decades, really) finally ate here. 
Hit it on a Sunday night.
Was hoping for a bit more but excellent fare, service and atmosphere.
Oysters to start, very good
Fish excellent. 
Duck very tasty.
Wine selection nicely offered. 
Dessert was also great.. 
I wish I could give 4.5...but was just missing that extra touch to make it perfect. So 4 it is.
I will be back.",27,,view review
99,,Ryan K.,17/07/23,,,,5,"Tasty American food. Duner's styles itself as a fine dining experience with white tablecloths and candles at every table and soft, slow music playing over the speakers. I ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts and stuffed zucchini. Before our appetizer arrived, we were served piping hot bread with cold butter on the side. The bread tasted like it had been frozen, but we were offered additional bread two times (we accepted once). The Brussels sprouts had an excellent combination of flavors. The zucchini was delicious with perfectly cooked tofu and was served on a bed of lemony greens. Overall, I had a nice time at Duner's and would recommend them for dinner.",674,21,view review

The service was not only timely, but pointed - they make you feel welcome. He found out it was my birthday at the end of the night & immediately offered a dessert drink (delicious). He made my birthday with old friends and it was a night I will remember. Shoutout to Dylan!",1,,view review
101,,Brandon B.,03/01/24,,,,4,"Duner's is pretty good. 4/5 for the Charlottesville fine dining scene. Everything you have will be good to great food-wise. Great beef tenderloin. 

Cocktails will be uninspired but classically alright. Alley Light makes Duner's effort look like cocktails made by children, but it's a good attempt. The wine list is stellar, however. That's what you drink here. 

All in all, it's worth recommending. The patio is the way to go. Plus for the drive, the bread is great.",221,10,view review

105,,Taylor R.,13/06/24,,,,5,"We came to Duner's for the first time tonight and would definitely come back here again because everything was amazing. I will say that the decor kind of threw me off because I was expecting something more of a fancy dinner vibe based on pictures but honestly it wasn't a big deal that it was more of a cozy vibe. I would describe it additionally as a casual but nice restaurant if that makes sense. Aside from that, everyone was really nice,  service was great, food and drink choices were not overwhelming and everything sounds amazing, and they have a great bar. For dinner we had the beef tenderloin, jumbo crab cakes, and a side of carrots. All of it was cooked to absolute perfection and the flavors all meshed well together. I'm a big crab cake person and loved them when I tried a bite from my husband. I opted for the tenderloin tonight though. We finished off with a flourless chocolate cake for dessert and off we went. I definitely recommend coming here and trying all of their amazing food.",131,31,view review

The staff was great, friendly and helpful and professional.",18,11,view review
109,,Christine B.,21/07/24,,,,4,My now husband went here for his graduation dinner many moons ago so we decided to go back on our mini-moon. No acknowledgment about our wedding which was a little sad. The bread here is awesome. He rated it in the top ten he's ever had and even brought some home. They change the menu frequently which is cool. They had a mushroom soup the day we went which was delicious. We tried the Brussel sprout side which was ok. It had like a soupy texture. For entrees I went with the mussels. The broth was good but a lot of the mussels didn't open like 7 or more. I mentioned it and they were nice enough to take it off the bill which I appreciated. My husband had a shrimp pasta that was really really good. He thought it was the best meal of the trip. I think it's worth going back.,944,124,view review
110,,Stephen B.,03/08/24,,,,4,"Overall a very nice meal.  The restaurant was completely full, but we had a reservation. and were seated without any wait.  Service was very warm, prompt and quite attentive service and the food was good.   We started with the fried oysters which were very good . . . lightly breaded, hot from the fryer, and nice remoulade sauce.  My wife had the crab cakes which were also very good with a very good slaw and I had the grilled salmon with a giant ricotta and ravioli and a relish of sun dried tomatoes and artichoke.  I asked for the salmon to be medium rare and unfortunately it was medium to medium well done, so a little disappointing but the ravioli and relish was very good.   Quite honestly the star of the meal was desert - chocolate peanut butter torte with a cashew and pecan crust and some creme anglaise - it was truly outstanding. 

Only other wish is that it weren't so loud.  We were in the ""side room"" and so it was a bit quieter than the main dining room, but we still had to talk very loud to hear one another however this has always been the case at Duner's",13,,view review

113,,Brenda K.,05/09/24,1,,1,4,"We had an early dinner. Our server, Sasha, was fantastic - attentive, but not hovering, and very knowledgeable about the food on the menu.

We ordered the Rainbow Trout Stuffed with Oysters & Spinach, Basmati Rice, Shallot & Caper Brown Butter and also the Duck Breast with Malibu Carrots, Risotto, and Red Wine Gastrique. The risotto was not to my liking (too much cheese) so it was replaced with mashed potatoes, which were very flavorful and delicious. For dessert we shared the Flourless Chocolate Cake which was served with whipped cream, and crème anglaise with a raspberry sauce - loved this dessert.",52,20,view review
114,,Ronald K.,20/09/24,,,,3,"Food was good, but clearly had been sitting under a food warmer, so the risotto was crusty and warm but not hot.  This restaurant is always busy so the service is slow.

I ordered fettuccine with sausage and shrimp but there was NO SAUSAGE to be found!   This is clearly unacceptable and is indicative of the new Duners, or whatever new moniker they will use.",5,,view review
