Maddy E.,20/09/18,1,,,4,"Asado was great overall! Our server Cindy was attentive and had great advice about the menu. The hickory wings were great but you can definitely taste the hickory smoke through all the flavors. I definitely recommend going on Wednesday nights, half off bottles of wine and wings!",4,365
Sierra C.,05/10/18,,,,4,"The food is fantastic. I recommend the philly wontons! The service is pleasant as well. If you're in need of a drink, stop by and talk to Mederio, the bartender. He makes the best drinks in Charlottesville, and can customize a drink creatively, to suit your eye and taste.",7,
Angel H.,08/10/18,,,1,5,"New restaurant where Cafe Caturra used to be. Decent food, great prices, and fantastic drinks! Happy hour deals are also so worth it. $4 margaritas?! What more can one ask for? The nacho fries were so good! Perfect ratio of fries, queso, and jalapeños, plus the fries were super crispy! Highly recommend! It's a large dish, so perfect for sharing. The pulled pork quesadillas were so cheesy and so juicy. The drinks weren't super strong but they were delicious. Loved the pomegranate sangria, it was very refreshing. The wine selection is decent as well. Patio is dog friendly and the vibe is awesome. Wooden benches were artsy but could be smoothened out and polished more. I definitely felt splinters when leaning back.",510,454
Sarah-Bradley D.,08/10/18,1,,1,5,"This is one of my new favorite stops on the corner. We went on a whim and were very happy with our choice especially because the area was equip with ample TVs to watch Sunday night football. We got the dip sampler which was awesome, the chips super thick and crisp. We then each got a taco. We originally thought $5.95 was steep for a taco but when they came out we understood why. Definitely a large portion. We got the Barbacoa and honey sriracha shrimp. The shrimp was heavy on the sriracha so warning for those who can't tolerate heat. The barbacoa was great but we wish the meat came out shredded instead of in chunks. The margs were also great. Definitely recommend this spot!",409,708
Melissa R.,12/10/18,,1,1,1,Ordered via Grubhub only to be called by the restaurant and told that they are out of wings. How does a restaurant that has Wings in their name run out of their signature dish? Poor planning. Will not order from here again.,14,
Kristen P.,28/10/18,,,,5,This place is a great casual and cheap spot! The tacos are delicious and the drink deals are unbeatable in charlottesville! I hope this place sticks around because it's delicious.,17,301
Ariel B.,18/11/18,,,,4,"Pretty good first time here! 

Will preference that I don't know much about Mexican food so I can't claim any authenticity. 

BUT will say that I loved the peach margarita that I had! Flavor was great and the strength of the drink was perfect. 

I got the potato taco (I totally forgot the name) and thought it was a perfect size for one person. Flavor was good as well! The food came out pretty quickly, service was great, and I loved the atmosphere on a Friday night. 

Good overall experience. Will be back for drink deals~",365,332
Chloe K.,23/01/19,,,,3,"Quality is good but seriously, I ORDERED 4 oz guacamole and half is SEED SERIOUSLY
BUT THE rest of the food is good. Affordable",8,240
Amelie S.,25/01/19,,,,2,"Food is great but the service makes it so hard to enjoy! Beginning with the host, everyone was irritated and made mistakes. It took about 15 minutes for our server to get to us. One of our orders came out wrong and it took forever to get our check. The place was understaffed and every employee seemed stressed. The food was a solid 8/10, but I would recommend giving this place a little more time to figure out what it's doing!!",22,1
Pavina S.,13/02/19,,,,3,"I got the dos amigos which came with a choice of taco and 6 wings. For the taco I got the honey sriracha fried shrimp and the sauce for the wings was pineapple teriyaki. There wasn't as much sauce  as I would have liked on the shrimp, but at least the shrimp itself tasted good. The wings were alright too but I've had better. Overall the food was nothing special especially considering the price you pay. There are much better and cheaper options around.",225,3
Caroline F.,18/02/19,1,,1,4,"It's a shame they changed their margarita recipe; now all the flavors are made with pineapple juice (even the ""plain"" one). Their fries, guac, and rice and beans are very tasty, and I've enjoyed most of the tacos I've ordered (but the steak can be overcooked). The bone-in wings are great and IMO a lot better than the boneless. The chips are to die for- definitely get the dip sampler",326,330
Nathan J.,20/02/19,,,,3,Fair food for a fair price. Would definitely come back but many better restaurants in the area.,6,
Carla M.,03/03/19,,,,2,"Don't go on a weekend. Had to wait for a while only to tell us we could use the booth right behind us.. and I didn't want to say anything because I've been a hostess before but at least mention the locations first before actually having to wait for a good option. Get to the table and it's all dirty, where I sat it was soaking wet. Had to sit there in a pile of water since we Waited like 10 minutes or more for a server... once the server gets to us, she doesn't even seem like she wants to be there. She asks are you guys ready to order, and we're like yes thinking she was taking our orders for drinks and apps like you would do else where...but then she's like ready to order food. I get it, it's busy, and she wants to keep it moving.. but to me it seemed like she was rushing us.. food was okay, I've had better tacos. The tortilla was cold i don't know if this is usually how they do there tacos. So be warned if you get the ya tacos & you like your food warm (ask to heat it up) Wings need more sauce, but good size. & you pay what your getting. Over all I don't think I'll be back. There's better places with better food & environment.",41,3
M H.,07/03/19,,,,4,"Asado is awesome. Food and drinks are great, just DONT order to go from them. They will either get the order very wrong or make you wait an hour longer then cancel the order.",5,
Abby S.,13/03/19,,,,5,"Asado is a great place! The food is great, the prices are good, and the portions are massive. The inside is very clean and looks great, it's a really good place to hang out and watch games. The daily specials are really fun and a great way to go out without spending a huge amount. The drinks are fantastic, and I love getting snacking foods and drinks while watching games. Karaoke is really awesome, and I can't wait to see what other fun events they come up with!",452,92
Rohan A.,19/03/19,,,2,3,"I used to regularly go to the Asados in richmond and was very excited to see that there was one opening up in Charlottesville. This place is always packed no matter the day of time. I'd definitely consider coming here during March madness to watch games.

The food in the other hand is GOOD but not on par with one in Richmond yet. However, I would say the staff and service is way better than the one in richmond so it balances out. I'd recommend getting the shrimp tacos. You can never go wrong with them. I didn't really like the wings they seemed a little off. Nonetheless the food was quality given the price.

I will definitely be back!",53,140
Sierra R.,20/03/19,,,,4,"It may take a long time to finally get your food, BUT DAMN! I am beyond satisfied every time I come to Asado. I get their cauliflower wings because I am vegetarian and they are always the B O M B ! Their drinks are pretty decent as well, not to my taste but still good. This is a great place to catch up with friends or watch a game. Overall, you can never go wrong with tacos and wings. Oh and their specials are always great!",3,
Harrison L.,20/03/19,,,,5,"This place is fairly new on the Corner but has become one of my favorites. It's a great place to bring friends and is fairly cheap. The tacos are really big and only $5. They have great drinks! The $5.50 margs all the time are a great deal. Would definitely recommend the sour patch rim. They have food and drink specials pretty much every day. I love the chori pollo taco but you really can't go wrong with any of them. The also have amazing wings and a variety of sauces (of varying spice levels) to choose from.

Inside it's what you would expect for a sports bar. There are lots of TVs for watching UVA basketball games (and other games too). The staff is always willing to help and super friendly.

I'll definitely be coming back here for cheap drinks and awesome food!",296,226
Stephen F.,25/03/19,,,,5,"Sometimes a reiteration of the order is necessary, especially when ordering over the phone but wings are great! Spicy Inferno BBQ is a particular favorite as it is a good honey BBQ flavor for those who like extra spice. Looking forward to an online ordering system in the future?",3,
Chelsea C.,27/03/19,1,,3,4,"My friend and I went for Taco Tuesday and how it works is that they choose one taco for that Tuesday to be half off! Considering the portion sizes, this is such a steal!! You can get a filling and delicious dinner for essentially $6! The interior is nice and our server was also really accommodating:) would go again!",41,538
Katherine L.,30/03/19,,,,4,"Wow! I didn't read the menu fully to realize that I ordered jumbo tacos. Honestly, I should have ordered only one instead of two. I'll definitely be back to try more tacos.",24,1
Morolake T.,14/04/19,1,,1,4,"Food: Asado has some BOMB wings. My personal favorite is the Spicy Inferno BBQ.  I highly recommend coming after 3 on Wednesday for half off wings. The Dos Amigos is also a good deal, which gets you 6 wings and a taco for like $11-$12 any day. I usually just get the Barbacoa taco, which has always been a solid choice.

Service: I think a lot of the servers are UVA undergrads, so they're all pretty chill and good about coming to your table to check-in. Bree/Bri (not sure how to spell it) has always been extremely polite, even when we've come in as a large and rowdy group. The bartender here is always very polite, attentive and just a fun guy. I think I've only had one poor experience when they told us there would be a 45 minute wait, and there were a ton of empty tables upstairs that were open.

This a good casual spot for just hanging with friends and having a solid plate of wings in C'ville.",147,302
Lauren H.,23/04/19,,,,5,Everything on their menu is so good! I'm obsessed with the Philly Cheesesteak egg rolls and cauliflower wings. They do an awesome karaoke night on Wednesday's and have fun deals everyday. You would be crazy to not get the chips here they are the best!,3,314
Lydia G.,27/04/19,,,,1,"My order was completely wrong, but how it was handled made my experience much worse. I ordered the fried fish tacos without the sauce, but they ended up coming with the sauce. After I ordered a new one and it came back, it was clear that they had just handled my food and wiped off some of the sauce. I think it's really unsanitary in general and ridiculous to expect a customer to eat food like that. I would really not recommend to anyone to go here and am not coming back ever again myself. Apart from the food being wrong and unsanitary, the service was slow. If you're in the mood for similar food go to any other spot on the corner or even Azteca, which is much higher quality Mexican food.",2,
Chloe M.,28/04/19,,2,,3,"I came to Charlottesville expecting a romantic getaway at Thomas Jefferson's University.  What I found instead was a dismal, heart-palpitation causing experience that left me feeling tattered and weary, and altogether broken.  Because of...

Asado.

These churlish bastards are a tricky lot.  They'll smile at you in all of their duplicity, meanwhile taking hour long shits rather than giving you the guacamole you ordered about an eon ago.  An eon is about one million years.  I figured that would be worth mentioning.

Tacos were good tho 3/5 stars",1,
Lee L.,03/05/19,1,1,,2,"worst service ever!!! i stg they lucky they got some good food cause the service is turrible kenny. they have like 20 people workin but none of them is workin and i know yall the know the sandwiches im makin, the mayo im spreading like gahhhhhdamn gemme some service... please",5,
Kyle S.,09/05/19,,,,1,"Just tried Asado for the first time- let me save you the hassle, don't get it. Food is greasy and barely edible. My taco was dripping with grease and it wasn't beef, but grilled chicken. Maybe if you are drunk you could be convinced this is anything but trash. Only thing redeeming is that the Chips and queso are actually good- but if you are a Mexican restaurant and the only thing decent at your restaurant is chips and queso there is probably something wrong.",1,85
Daniel W.,19/06/19,,,,4,"Wings were good, not perfect, but I would go back to try some other sauces, especially for half off Wednesdays. My wife had a potato and mushroom burrito and absolutely loved it.",1,
Joy L.,02/07/19,,,,4,"I eat here so much it's unhealthy. The buffalo cauliflower taco is really good. The fried ice cream sandwich is amazing too. I love the fries, but sometimes they are inconsistent - sometimes I get a really good batch that has this salt on the outside, a few times they've been soggy. Would recommend",3,
Alexis Y.,06/07/19,,,,1,"The service here is absolutely pitiful. Don't expect to see your food for at least an hour after ordering. I've been here 3 times, and each time it's exactly the same. I ordered a margarita, they gave me the wrong one, then told me they were too busy to make a new one and charged me full price. Our table's food was either lukewarm or cold, and we had to ask specifically for silverware and napkins- they gave us plastic forks and knives ?? The chicken is always tough, they never refill water glasses- an all around nightmare. The best thing about this place is the location.",7,
Tara M.,07/07/19,,,1,2,"Sad. Server and host: nice and apologetic for the longest wait times for the simplest drink (draft beer) and simple food (salsa and chips, tacos) Food: salsa was decent, not spicy at all. Chips: ok. Tacos: 1 of 3 we had were good. Two obviously not fresh off the grill as they were barely warm, fish smelt old. Table: sticky even after wiped down. Floors: dirty. And dark, poor lighting in booths.

I mean the long wait would have been worth it if the food was amazing but..eh unimpressive.",10,110
Rarione M.,21/07/19,,,,5,The wings were great! We went on a Thursday during extended happy hour. I had a shrimp taco which was really good and pretty large for a taco. One taco filled me up!,14,7
Rob F.,28/07/19,,,,4,"Good food and pretty good drink specials for the area. I was worried about the size of a dinner of two tacos and rice for $11, but the tacos could be better described as small burritos. Had some pretty interesting choices and the waitress was very helpful. 

Good place for the price.",20,167
Frank R.,15/08/19,,,,5,Great food! The smoked wings were perfect! A little crunchy with a nice buffalo saesoning!,8,321
Michael M.,20/10/19,,2,2,1,The food was absolutely atrocious.  The tacos are poorly arranged and it's like the ingredients were just thrown on the tacos. The mixed drinks are super sweet and taste nothing like margaritas.  It tools 30 minutes to get our first round of drinks. The blue cheese provided for the wings was lumpy not like a sauce you could use for wings. It was an overall horrible experience.,2,
Vita W.,26/10/19,2,1,3,4,"-What you need to know in a sentence: HUGE portions of you guessed it...wings and tacos, plus other rando tex mex options
-Ambiance in threeish words: a cutesy bbq joint
-Treated like: we're in a town of undergrads who care more about booze and less about service (when we're in fact grad students who do care about service)
-Must try: Baja fish taco, brisket taco, cauliflower wings are v good for my vegetarians!
-Other random tidbits: you're on the corner so there's either a paid parking garage very close or street parking",65,15
Isabelle S.,25/11/19,,,,4,"Tacos are AMAZING!! The wings are pretty good too, but I think next time I'll get only the tacos instead of the taco and wing combo. Super cute place too!",4,
Amanda C.,03/12/19,,,1,2,"I was really let down by this place. I had heard great things from my friends but I was really disappointed. The service was decent, food took awhile to come, but nothing ridiculous. The food just wasn't good and the portions weren't worth the price or quality. You're much better off just going to chipotle which is better, cheaper, and has larger portions.",111,3
Houdus 0.,01/01/20,,,,4,"You have to try the philly cheesesteak  eggrolls. They are delicious!! The lemon pepper wings are my favorite.  A lot of places makes them to salty, but Asado makes them just right.  If your looking for a good drink, try one of their margaritas.  The blood orange and raspberry are my go to flavors.",14,
Angelena G.,18/01/20,,,,3,The veggie are wings are good but stay away from everything else but the margs. Our server kept saying we should stay for their 10 o'clock Thursday night karaoke.... stayed until 11 and no one sang. Essentially was in the middle of a sorority get together. Felt like the oldest person there...although can't argue with their happy hour deals.,3,282
Christine X.,22/01/20,,,1,1,"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. They completely ignore online orders. They accept/confirm them and then NEVER MAKE THEM. Is this really the experience you want to create for your customer base, just because they're buying food from you that's not as financially advantageous to the staff in terms of tips? If that's a dealbreaker, remove yourselves from the apps! Don't accept orders! But to accept/confirm orders and then just never pass them along to actually be made is a completely unacceptable way to run a business. Gross. Management needs to take the task of running a business seriously. Lesson learned, and it'll earn them some nice word-of-mouth reviews for the trouble. Thanks for literally nothing.",36,
Lydia P.,08/04/20,,,1,5,"I've only gotten takeout from here and only got the tacos. The tacos are AMAZING. Can't speak to the service or other food items. I like the honey sriracha shrimp, Buffalo with grilled chicken, and brisket tacos best.",7,
Jimmy H.,27/04/20,,,,5,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! First time ordering from here, I did take out today.  Everything is so fresh! The guacamole is off the chain! My order was ready quickly and the pick up process was extremely easy.  The tacos, though $5 each, are huge and prepared very well.  I believe they are worth the price.  I would go again in a heart beat!",24,490
Valorie E.,17/05/20,,,,5,"Awesome chicken wings.  Good sized.  Wish they were a little crispier, but good nonetheless.  We also opted for margaritas since they are my FAVORITE!  Ended up going agains my better judgement and getting a flavored marg and it was EXCELLENT!!  We got the mango and pear flavor and both were delicious. Not too sweet and just right!  Will definitely go here again and maybe just for the drinks!",219,451
Emily J.,20/06/20,,,,3,"Fries and queso -- TO DIE FOR
quesadillas are always really greasy and the new pulled pork quesadilla has too much sauce. it's a bit overpowering
wings are alright - the best sauce is honey bbq and honey sriracha is quite hot*
*ranch is gentle but gets job done
spiked lemonade was quite good! frozen peach marg is also a good option.
service is decent - college town but basics are always taken care of
overall, not a bad bite if you're feeling casual and a drink or two!",2,
Tiffany L.,30/06/20,1,,2,3,We ordered by phone and picked up our dinner order. The food was good but I was expecting larger tacos based on the other yelp reviews. Fillings were tasty but didn't particularly impress me. Wings were crispy and large and we had the sauces on the side so that they wouldn't get soggy. A good restaurant but with the other excellent tex mex options here in C'ville I probably wouldn't go back.,1365,139
Jessica H.,10/07/20,,,,5,Just stopped in for lunch not knowing where to eat in Charlottesville and it was great!  The wings were huge and perfectly cooked and my husband loved the burrito!  Would definitely come back next time we visit.,5,
Jeremy W.,14/07/20,,,1,4,"My friend and I were looking for a new spot to eat in Charlottesville and stumbled across Asado, we took a brief look over the menu and headed in. We were greeted by a bunch of friendly staff that took us to our seat. 

We ended up getting the chips and queso and the loaded Cajun fries to start with, both were good. The chips were super crunchy and went well with the queso, but honestly I was more into the loaded Cajun fries. The fries itself had good seasoning, and pairing that with the jalapeños and queso made for a great combination. 

Then we got our tacos. I ended up getting the honey sriracha shrimp taco and the pineapple teriyaki shrimp taco. (I had them both with fried shrimp) The honey sriracha one was surprisingly spicy and it was balanced out with the more sweet pineapple teriyaki shrimp taco. Both were good and I'd definitely recommend giving those two a shot. 

Everything we had was good, but it still felt like it was missing something to make it amazing. Nevertheless, I definitely recommend and will be returning to try more tacos!",91,6
Rick C.,16/07/20,,,,4,"This restaurant like many others was struggling with the Covid issues we are all seeing. They were allowing very limited seating inside due to distancing regulations, so i ordered take out. I had teriyaki shrimp tacos and wow i am going back for more.
From the takeout point of view, the restaurant looked very clean and pleasant to be in so i wouldn't be  averse to eating in when possible. Staff are friendly and quite helpful.
I asked about portion size and was given what i consider to be a very acurate description.",32,
Alex K.,17/07/20,,,1,5,Absolutely the best smoked chicken wings on the planet and perhaps even on Mars. Well trained staff excellent prices and collectible choices. I don't normally have a drink in the middle of the day but I went there for lunch today my wife ordered her usual glass of white wine and I ordered a cocktail from their specialty menu. Outstanding can't wait to come back and bring friends. Large deck to accommodate you large commodious interior with a very high ceilings to assure proper ventilation and everyone is practicing social distancing with maps. If I owned a restaurant it would be just like this,5,590
Caitlin C.,11/08/20,,,2,4,"I haven't been here since covid so I can't comment on how well they're handling service and social distancing guidelines. However, I order from here a lot and love going here to eat. 

I always get the taco salad with honey lime dressing--it's so filling because of all the toppings and a great price point. If I add shrimp it usually lasts me two meals. I also really like their quesadillas because there's a solid amount of cheese and I like the vegetarian (mushroom) option. I've only had a taco once and it was tasty but I sort of wish they were smaller tacos. 

People rave about the chips--for me they're a little too thick but I still enjoy eating their nachos (because I love the queso). I also think their French fries are overly salted. 

Overall the atmosphere is great. They have good deals on food and drinks, karaoke is fun, and they have a lot of fun drinks (I really enjoy the frozen margaritas).",157,26
Chad S.,19/08/20,3,1,5,4,"My first interaction was standing at the outdoor hostess stand... waiting for the hostess to actually take a second to acknowledge me standing there as she wrestled with the cash register or computer or whatever she was doing for another for another staff member.  Finally, a very nice server saw what was going on as she was rolling silver and decided to take charge, greet and seat me... thank you whoever you are.

Anyway, moving on...

Ordered the Dip sampler, buffalo wings and Chori Pollo Taco

Dip sampler... was missing 1/3 of the sample because they ran out of guacamole... WTF, guess it's not made to order for sure.  Anyway, chips are really good but could use more salt... queso is ok... kinda like bland cheese with a slow-arriving bit of heat afterwards... salsa pretty decent 

Taco for me could have been an immediate fail because no corn tortillas... but when it was described as ""Jumbo"" I wasn't expecting corn.  When it arrived (as you can see from the pics) a lot of lettuce, not so much meat... well, that's what I thought h 'til biting into it.  Pretty dang amazing flavor.

The wings were good... them being grilled added a little something to them beyond the usual.

As a follow up to the initial experience at hosts stand, the staff (including the hostess pretending not to see me) were all on task and welcoming.

All in all, pretty solid dive if you're looking for a cold beer, wings and tacos.",288,100
Jessi S.,30/08/20,1,3,4,4,"I was attracted to the place firstly for having HH on a Saturday! Unfortunately, day drinking got the best of us and we missed it. I was surprised that there was a wait at 8:30pm, but it was only 10 minutes. The margaritas were pretty disappointing: the waiter talked us all into a double, but I think I actually sobered up rather than maintain my buzz. Luckily, the food satisfied all of our cravings. I got the brisket burrito and it was GOOD with creamy delicious queso smothered all over it. I'm use to having chips and salsa and a giant burrito with sides when it comes to eating out, but all those extras are extra $. The chip and dip sampler came with this awesome salsa and super crunchy chips to dip, yet the queso could have been a little thicker and the guac lacked oomf. My other table mates both got the dos amigos and tried both styles of wings with spicy garlic being the winner. I got to try a bite of the chorizo chicken taco and that was exploding with flavor in my mouth! And the honey sriracha shrimp taco was good and spicy, too!

COVID-wise, they are trying....but they did not stop customers from walking around mask-less when going to the bathroom and the bathroom had no soap.",437,386
Ben S.,04/09/20,,,1,4,"We popped in for a quick drinkiepoo and between the service and the food we saw coming out decided to cancel our dinner plans and stay for dinner.  I had the Dos Amigos (6 wings and a taco) and the wife tried the vegetarian wings.  

Hey!!  Listen up, this is a TASTY Spicy Garlic sauce!!!   It's really tasty.   I enjoyed the smoked pork taco, but the wings were the show stopper. I will crave those. 

Service was delightful in some respects and dismissive in others.  Oh well, it happens.  Overall, I would recommend for drinks or food!  Check it out.",119,209
Aubrey P.,27/09/20,,,1,4,"Wings are fantastic!! Had the pineapple teriyaki, and I worried it would be too sweet, but it was perfectly balanced with the smokiness of the wings. Truly, I just want a bucket of those next time. Also, ranchaholics will appreciate the flavor and creaminess of the peppercorn ranch. It had the perfect consistency for clinging to the wings. Tacos were good, but it's truly hard to top those wings! Also, had cajun fries, which were simple, but flavorful from the seasoning and the queso. Service was good, and the tables are well spaced for distancing. Will be dreaming about these wings until I can get by here again.",11,
Morgan K.,08/10/20,,,1,5,"AMAZING POTATOES!!! Try the papas bravas it's one of the best sides I've ever had (there's also a taco version my friend & I split, great portion btw)!!! I came her with my friends twice and both times it's been amazing, and the customer service is so great, everyone is super nice. This last time I forgot my to-go at the table and when I came back to get it they made me a new one in five minutes max and brought it out with no trouble. Overall, such a great experience here!!! Also I really recommend the chips with queso for groups of 2+ as an appetizer",6,
Meg S.,09/10/20,,,1,1,"NEVER GOING BACK

We just visited yesterday for the first time expecting a nice meal and a few drinks and was shocked by how disgustingly rude the managerial staff was. Our waitress was absolutely wonderful and very sweet but after a horrible experience with the kitchen and manager I will never return. 

We waited more than an hour and a half for our food. It was a busy night and after our appetizer, they brought one entree out 40 minutes before the rest of the food was served. One meal was completely incorrect and another cold. Our waitress said the manager agreed to give us half off our meal for the inconvenience,  then brought three incorrect bills to the table- none half off. After asking for a manager 4 times someone finally came to the table (who was clearly not a manager) to talk to us. The whole time I was explaining what happened and trying to get a correct bill, he spent rolling his eyes and looking at the bar. 

Then comes the actual manager storming over to our table and proceeded to throw a tantrum, screaming in my face , slamming his hands down on our table and even crumpling the bill and throwing it in my 16 year old sisters face. He told us to leave and never return since we refused to pay the bill (which I never once did). Once he shut up long enough for me to explain what actually happened he apologized for his behavior and the misunderstanding and we left. 

However I will NEVER return to an establishment that thinks it's ok to treat customers like that, even in a frustrating and heated situation. Mangers are meant to be keeping their cool and leading their team not throwing tantrums and screaming at customers for THEIR lack of understanding the of situation. Truly disgraceful.",1,7
Jen R.,18/11/20,1,,3,4,"We took our son and his roommates here for lunch and had a great meal. The restaurant is located in The Corner area, at the edge of Grounds at UVA.

We were able to sit outside and be socially distanced. It was a beautiful afternoon, but I saw that they have heaters available for when it gets cooler.

Our server brought waters right away and took our orders quickly. Most of the guys got the Dos Locos Tacos which came with a taco and wings. It was a lot of good, and they all said how tasty the wings are. I shared a Baja fish taco and honey sriracha shrimp taco with my husband...they were both quite large and more than enough food for the two of us. The tacos were delicious, and a little spicy (for me), but most people probably wouldn't find them too hot. 

I also had one of their margaritas--raspberry, and it was quite tasty. I'd definitely like to have one when it's hotter outside. 

Overall, great food and the prices are reasonable.",141,55
MP G.,19/12/20,,,1,5,Honestly some of the best wings in town are here at Asado! I ordered 10 minutes before the kitchen closed during a cold Wednesday night which is when they have half price wings! My wings were ready in 10 minutes. I got the 12 piece which typically costs $13 or so. So worth it. The wings were cooked well and the meat was moist and flavorful inside. And then the pineapple teriyaki sauce was sweet and savory. Perfect punch. I added the loaded nachos with the beef and wow. I finished them all by myself it was that good. Worth coming back for. I've had their tacos and cheesesteak egg rolls - definitely need to get these!,234,228
Megana K.,23/01/21,1,,1,5,"I've been here a couple times and always had a great time. Although their vegetarian options are limited, the ones they do have are phenomenal. Asado is definitely my favorite place to get tacos.",42,21
Jesilyn G.,28/01/21,,,1,5,"You HAVE to try the potato taco!! The Asado's in Charlottesville has the best one! The Richmond one was meh. 

We came here for my 21st birthday, and the waitress gave me a free birthday drink! My friend and I split the dip sampler. I've had a lot of guacamole, but this was THE best guac I've ever had. The chips were so good to! (I never thought I'd like chips and guac this much)

Passionfruit margarita was great!!! If you can't stand the alcohol taste, this is a great drink choice. 

My friend got the blood orange one, and it definitely tasted stronger, so not my favorite.",53,22
Ben L.,08/02/21,,,,5,"One of my favorite spots in Charlottesville. Great service, really nice people, really good food. They were overrun with orders Super Bowl Sunday, and there was a mixup in my pickup order. They were extremely gracious and delivered the food to me very quickly.  The wings were delicious and it ended up being a great night (aside from Tampa winning).  Highly recommend.",3,
Ryan K.,21/02/21,,,1,4,"Pretty tasty food! Now that Wild Wing Cafe has closed, Asado has the best wings in Charlottesville. We ordered the spicy buffalo wings, honey sriracha shrimp tacos, and papas bravas tacos. I thought both tacos were kind of bland but they were both creative ideas and certainly not unappetizing. I would certainly order from Asado again for the wings, but I would like to try different tacos next time.",674,21
Kat G.,27/02/21,,,,2,"Decided to try out Asado as they offer my two favorites - tacos and wings! I ordered a quesadilla and pineapple teriyaki wings 
The wings were ok, not my favorite. I was hoping the quesadilla was better, it was ok. Chicken was dry, salsa had no flavor and I was disappointed with the presentation.",552,116
Jeanette J.,04/03/21,,,,1,Listen...I enjoy your food BUT I will not be ordering from here anymore. I had an online order that was ready at 1:10. I get there and 20 minutes have passed by. I finally had to ask for a refund because of parking and that took long and they didn't even give me a receipt. The girl at the front said it was getting prepared and still nothing. Y'all need to fix this. I don't have time to waste my lunch.,1,
Loren M.,16/03/21,,,,2,"I have very little positive feedback about this place :(
We got a large assortment of items to try.
The jalapeño poppers were okay. 
The philli cheesesteak eggrolls were okay...
The salad was okay, not great
The tacos were not good :/
I got Buffalo cauliflower, portbella, and the potato tacos. All of which tasted sour for some reason?! To the point I couldn't eat them.
We got wings, which were also sad. The skin was chewy, and well they were really not appetizing.
Unfortunately a lot of money was wasted...  :( 
We won't be back. Lesson learned",73,4
Anna M.,24/03/21,1,,,4,"asado is a very popular spot for the college students, so expect the food and drinks to be consistently good, a very safe option, and good on a budget. They have great specials during the week and the food always comes out quickly. We like to watch games here too, it's always packed. The tacos are flavorful, the margaritas come in really unique flavors (pear is super good) and we never fail to get Queso",38,11
Jasmine S.,07/04/21,,,,5,"we went on a busy friday evening and it was quite packed indoors, but were seated within minutes. we ordered chicken wings and cauliflower wings and they all came out so delicious--we finished everything within minutes! maybe we were just super hungry or the food was actually that good, nonetheless i would definitely come back again!!",7,
Charles C.,18/04/21,,,,3,I had a very fine dining experience at Asado. There was fast service with good food and a kind server. It wasn't until there was a slight altercation with a bartender where I was disappointed. For a slight disagreement this bartender completely overreacted while I was leaving and said f**k you to me as I was leaving. This made the establishment seem rather hostile to me and for that I will not be eating there again.,5,
Emily A.,27/04/21,,,,5,"AMAZINGGGG foood. Always worth any sort of wait, I have tried just about everything in the menu and had zero bad experiences. service is always wonderful and would recommend to anyone.",10,1
Stephanie S.,23/05/21,,,,5,Great food and a nice bartender that knows how to make a margarita. Will definitely go back.,40,
Mac S.,25/05/21,,1,1,1,"After completing my 4, yes FOUR, hour excursion to this establishment (if you can even call it that, I prefer the term ""incompetent eatery"") I can confidently say the imbecilic staff and lifeless margaritas made me want to jump out of their second story windows. You'd be better off begging for food on the benches of the corner than being served properly at Asado's. I'm gonna go cry myself to sleep now. :(",1,
Tristan G.,28/05/21,,,1,5,"It's honestly pretty bewildering to see people complain about the crowd or service here. Do not go to Asado on a Friday evening while school is in and expect anything less than a packed house of UVA undergrads. If you want to avoid that maybe go to the downtown mall instead of the corner. 

Food wise, Asado is great. The wings here are unbreaded and smoked till the skin is crispy then spun graciously in sauce. I usually get the em with spicy Buffalo sauce which is pretty spicy but not to the point where it's all heat and no flavor. Indisputably the best wings Ive had in Charlottesville.

The tacos here are also very good. I'm a huge fan of the smoked pork taco which has both pineapple coleslaw and jalapeños on it which combines for a very satisfying sweet and spicy dynamic. The tacos are pretty big so if you aren't super hungry one taco might be enough food. 

I've eaten at Asado many times and will likely eat here many more.",2,
Shay T.,20/06/21,,,1,5,"This place was great!! My boyfriend and I had wings and tacos. The kitchen fried them extra crispy like we asked and had the perfect amount of dry rub and sauce. I got lemon pepper and he got bbq. He had the double smoked bacon chicken taco and the brisket tacos, he absolutely LOVED the bacon chicken taco and really liked the brisket one but said it was no match for the chicken taco. I had the honey siracha shrimp tacos and the Baja fish taco tacos (both grilled) and the honey siracha taco sent me to outer space it was great, I wish I order 2. The Baja fish taco was good but no match for the honey siracha taco. We both had 2 drinks, I had the blood orange margarita, which both were great and strong. My boyfriend had 2 bud lights and said they hit the spot. We will definitely be back next time we're down in Charlottesville.",33,31
Sepand S.,18/07/21,,,2,1,This place is absolutely terrible. We ordered our food and they tried charging us with 2 extra meals. We tried saying it wasn't ours but they charged us either way very disrespectfully. Never come to this place I highly do NOT recommend,3,
Justin N.,19/07/21,1,,1,4,"Came here with friends on a Thursday night for their extended happy hour and 1/2 off boneless wings. So much fun! The food is decent. But their daily specials are what make Asado great. The atmosphere inside is awesome for grabbing casual drinks and snacks with friends. Being right on The Corner, the crowd is predominately college students. 

I ordered 12 of their Boneless Pineapple Teriyaki Wings and a Frozen Key Lime Margarita for around 10 dollars total. The wings were great and hit the spot. I also tried their Frozen Pomegranate Sangria which was delicious, and I would definitely order it again the next time I visit on a hot day.",372,109
Aubrey W.,27/07/21,,,1,5,"Time and time again, Asado delivers delicious food and drinks in a lively atmosphere. One of my favorite restaurants on the Corner, there is truly something for everyone here. There are special deals nearly every day of the week (my friends and I like to go on Thursdays for 1/2 off boneless wings and frozen margaritas). The wings are delicious, and come in a variety of different flavors and heat levels. The pineapple teriyaki is a personal favorite. The frozen pomegranate sangria is absolutely delicious, and incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day. If interested in a frozen drink, make sure to ask what they have currently available (usually a lime margarita plus 1-2 other options). They have many other cocktails and margarita flavors, but most are served on the rocks. The tacos are also excellent: the smoked brisket is a must, but the new pineapple teriyaki shrimp taco is also yummy. Overall you can't go wrong with Asado, especially with a big group looking for a fun evening in Charlottesville.",168,27
Carolina C.,12/09/21,,1,1,1,"Had the absolute worst experience here. The waiter (who also happens to be the manager) was so rude. He made a massive scene trying to kick us out for walking in with a white claw that we agreed to throw out. There were no garbage cans in sight so we assumed he would just take it and throw it away for us. Instead he decided to scream at us across the outdoor patio to get the hell out and that he wouldn't serve us at all. Every table was staring and it was humiliating. The man was ignoring us when we tried to speak with him and making fun of my friends for their Spanish accent. So disrespectful and no way to treat guests. Luckily we got traded out for a super sweet waitress who was helpful with diffusing the situation. Big tip for her for putting up with that rude manager. Oh and the food isn't good either.

Just to add to the situation, they messed up our order and gave us the check and credit card of the table next to us so we ended up paying for their dinner.",34,76
A D.,13/09/21,,,,4,Came he for a quick snack. Monday late afternoon so pretty empty. Waitresses were very attentive. Got a siracha shrimp taco which I thought was very big and great flavor.  The steak egg rolls were just ok.,76,
Casey H.,19/11/21,,,,3,"I've have waited at this joint for 45mins for a singular margarita on a Wednesday night. To be fair, they weren't busy at all. But I'm addition, the drink was good but was it worth a the wait? I'll let others decide...",9,
Kasha T.,11/12/21,,,,5,"This was a solid meal-- flavorful, tender chicken, and delicious guac! If you're at UVA, totally stop by. There's even a cute little outdoor section in the back that's a little secluded from the hustle and bustle of the main street.",176,12
Sally J.,29/12/21,,,1,1,"Overall extremely dissatisfied from this meal- I would have rather gone to Sheetz to be completely honest. For starters, after spending all day hiking we were looking for something good, filling, satisfying, etc. And may I add- not a hard crowd to please at all. For starters we got the Sampler (chips with pico, queso, and guac) and the Brisket nachos. The chips were not ordinary, which is something that unpleasantly surprised us. They're more like fried tortillas. Very thick. The nachos I will say we're quite satisfying to me, not the rest of our crowd though. For main, one of us got the Cajun wings and another got buffalo and bbq honey. Bro if I can tell u one thing- DONT GET THE BONELESS WINGS. I was mega looking forward to them and they tasted like they were fried once a day everyday starting two weeks ago and then frozen and refried and set under a heat lamp and then doused in the sauce. The others got quesadillas and no more impressive. Ambiance was OK, probs a fun place to go with friends for drinks before going out but personally as I said like I woulda rather gone to a gas station.",31,
Alice J.,29/12/21,,,,1,"Don't waste your time or money here. I'm not even sure if they knew we were customers; after they sat us they didn't acknowledge us for a good 20 minutes. The food sucks. My friend ordered the dry rub Cajun wings and I said he would've rather eaten dirt. So disappointed in both the service and quality of food. I will eat at Taco Bell for Mexican food before I ever come back to this disgusting ""establishment"". I wish I read over the reviews before dropping $90 on food. 

PS--a health inspector should check this place out based on the quality of food...bit into blue chicken.",15,
Sonya M.,01/01/22,,,1,5,"The food and drinks here were delicious! The chicken wings were delicious, the nachoes were tasty, and the guac and queso? *chef's kiss*. My cousins couldn't stop raving about this place since they would always go to the one in Richmond, but this was my first time going to an Asado's and it didn't disappoint. Definitely may frequent this place again if I'm back in the area.",270,286
Nancy H.,04/03/22,1,,1,4,"Came here on Thursday for their half off boneless wings. Got the honey bbq and it was delish, Asado has never disappointed me with the wings. I've tried other flavors here and they've also been quite delicious. My friend got sweet potatoes fries and mentioned that she wished the fries had salt. I was disappointed by the fact that they were unable to seat us inside though. Usually they ask if we wanted to sit inside or outside but today they told me that they are unable to do separate waiting lists for inside or outside. It was pretty cold and the heaters outside did not work despite employees trying to fix them. All in all, the food here is fantastic, the prices are unbeatable, and it's a great place to grab dinner with friends.",201,33
Shrinath D.,02/04/22,1,,,4,"Asado Taco & Wing Factory is one of my favorite eats in Charlottesville, VA! All of their food is to die for, and their menu is constantly innovating. 

As a vegetarian, I am in love with their Cauliflower Wings (reminds of gobi manchurian with a zesty and spicy twist). All of their sauces complement the dishes well!

Their tacos are also equally as flavorful. My two favorites are the Papas Bravas and Spicy Portobello. Both are filling and satisfying and make my meal each time. 

The nachos are HUGE and amazing. The queso is light but packed with flavor and complements all the ingredients perfectly. 

Asado's combos make it easy to try multiple dishes without breaking the bank!",181,115
Yun C.,03/04/22,1,,,5,Their shrimp tacos? Chef's kiss. So good they were fresh and flavorful and the tacos are probably bigger than you would expect so the price was definitely worth it for me.,13,
Hunter S.,08/04/22,,,,5,"My favorite restaurant on the corner for sure, Asado has the vibe of an upscale place without the upscale price. The service is fast and consistent and the food is excellent, with many options like wings and tacos. I'm a big fan of the wing flavors, and the portion sizes are great. It's a popular stop so the wait times can get a bit long - but the specials are worth it!",31,7
Lindsey V.,16/04/22,,,,3,"As one of the most popular places on the corner, there is often a wait or the service is kind of slow. The food is pretty good it just depends on what you get. The lemon pepper wings are usually good, but I ordered them as takeout and they seemed like different wings than I had ever ordered. They were tough and almost inedible, I have no idea why. I also got the loaded fries which were just terrible. 

The atmosphere is very loud so just expect that if you go. It's just not somewhere I'd recommend taking a visitor of charlottesville, compared to other options.",105,10
Maggie T.,20/04/22,,2,,4,"There are two types of people in this world: people who think of Asado as a taco place and people who think of it as a wing place. They do both so well that I'd say the camps are pretty evenly split. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants on the corner, their taco Tuesday and wing Wednesday half-off specials can't be beat and it's usually worth the ever-present wait times for a table. Service in my experience has ranged from slow to average, although understandly as they are always busy. Knocked off a star due to lack of consistency - sometimes their wings are way too smoky for my taste that it even overpowers the sauce/dry rub seasoning. 

Quick tip: for their specials, if you end up needing a to-go box they'll charge you full price so make sure you only order what you can eat! Not sure when they started this policy as it seems to be a recent thing",17,7
Autumn H.,12/05/22,,,,1,"Every day of every week they run out of the deal and then have a nasty attitude with customers. I've never entered a restaurant feeling so disrespected by management. The servers are nice and accommodating but the managers are quite probably the worst I've ever encountered in the food industry. As someone that works in food you never let the customer leave unhappy and they lose people each and every time they decided to close the restaurant in the middle of the day, cut service hours before close, and never honor a substitution of the deals.",1,

Jana W.,19/06/22,,,,1,"The food was decent. The service was probably the worst I have ever had in my life. We ordered chips and queso and one margarita to start. Twenty minutes later, noting had arrived. I asked and was told that the bar was slammed. They were not. We were sitting in view of the bar. There was only one other table seated. The bartender was HIGH. He could barely function and we saw him outside after we left smoking more.... The waitress was nice but clueless. The chips and queso arrived at the same time as our meal. I finally got the margarita 10 minutes after my food and it did not include the special ""rim"" they so heavily promote. She seemed confused as to why we would want drinks and appetizers as we ordered them and before our food arrived. Would never go back. Too many other amazing places to go in town.",1,
Claire J.,30/06/22,,,,4,"Wednesday 1/2 off wings is an awesome deal. Got honey BBQ, spicy BBQ, and pineapple teriyaki. Honey barbecue was #1 with Spicy BBQ closely behind (but it's definitely spicy!!).  Decent service. Known for their margaritas!",16,45
Emily L.,14/07/22,,,,2,"Food was 5/5 but service was 0/5. Before I get into the food just wanted to talk about our server. When we ordered all the food the server looked at us confused and asked ""is this all for here or take out?"" and we were also confused and responded that it was for here. The server then reiterated that because it was Tuesday all tacos were half off so that meant we couldn't order any more - implying that what we ordered was too much for the three of us? We kind of brushed it off and ignored the server from then. The service was really slow but understandable since it was the last day of classes. When the server came with our food they only brought two of our orders while my friend was left without a order. We asked what happened to our friend's order and the server rolled their eyes and said that they ""didn't write it down"". So we obviously were annoyed and sat there and waited for my friend's order. The server came with the food and just dropped it in front of my friend spilling the contents inside the tacos and walked away without saying anything. After eating, we were all splitting the check and we simply just wanted the total to be split into three but when the server came back all the prices were extremely different even though we all ordered the same thing. This back Ajax forth happened multiple times and I was fed up and offered to just pay the whole thing and have my friends Venmo me back but my friend asked the server for the manager and the server looked upset and annoyed at this request. What annoyed me the most is that every time the server set down our ""split checks"" they were smirk at us as if they knew what they were doing and got a laugh at our annoyed reactions - really uncalled for. Thankfully, the manager was able to help us out with the checks. I have a hard time emphasizing with the server because I would understand if they were new, having a bad day, etc. but just the overall judgmental and childish attitude of the server ruined our moods. 

The food was delicious which definitely lighten up the mood. We shared pineapple teriyaki wings and honey bbq boneless wings. I usually don't like boneless but in this case I actually preferred the boneless because the chicken was extremely tender and juicy and honey bbq is always a fav. I got the pineapple teriyaki shrimp (fried) tacos and they were the perfect mixture of sweet, savory, and tanginess. My friends absolutely enjoyed their tacos as well. 

We will happily come back to asados in hopes that we don't get served by the same server.",41,34

Derek L.,20/11/22,,,,5,"Jackpot. Amazing flavorful tacos. Wonderful service. And a full belly(great portion sizes for price).What more could you want?

On to the specifics:
Honey siracha taco was pretty good. I'm ngl, it was a bit overhyped from what my friends told me but that doesn't invalidate it as still a good taco. It's a simple tangy sweet and spicy flavor loaded with toppings. Shrimp was grilled extremely well.

Pineapple teriyaki taco was my favorite. It hits you with that one two jab of sweet and savory and knocks you out with a mild Smokey after taste.",30,
Haley U.,02/12/22,,,,1,Food & drinks were good. Went to dinner with a friend that I haven't seen awhile to catch up.  we were done eating and paid the check. the servers kept giving us side eyes.

Rosalind B.,18/01/23,2,1,4,4,"I've yet to have a weak drink from here. They hide it well - the drinks taste like something you might find in a lunchables. Even the double margaritas go down like caprisuns.

Typically, I'm at the bar. (Also, can't believe I'm already at ""typically,"" here. *lol*) I've always had fast, pleasant service. There's one person there that gives off such chill and pleasant vibes whenever my daughter and I visit. I'll leave her name in the tips, if I remember to get it next time.

The fish and the shrimp tacos are dope.",143,466
Emily B.,20/02/23,1,1,1,5,"Asados tacos are the best in town by far. Not quite a traditional taco but so much better in my opinion. Sriracha Shrimp is great and pineapple teriyaki too. They have deals for math monday and boneless wings and wine wednesday etc. The prices are honestly still too high for what the food is though and I hate the decrease in wing amount and the fact that you can't take boxes out anymore. The rule is stupid and i've heard that the managers aren't great. I liked the old way that this place was run. Anyways, the food is still really good and ambience is fun with good music played by staff who are mostly students.

Brooke B.,25/03/23,,,,2,"I'll never have a complaint about Asado's food, but I did have a bad experience today. We had a very unassuming waiter who seemed impatient for us to order. There were 8 people total for a birthday dinner and we just wanted to chat for a little before ordering. A few people were missing items/got extra, but it was corrected ok. One of my friends mentioned to him that it was my birthday, assuming that he would bring a birthday shot like she got just a month ago for hers, but he said they don't do anything for birthdays and left. When he came back 3 of the people asked him to clarify (saying they did it a month ago) and he said he would have to card everyone at the table. Huh? He then brought 4 birthday churros which each person had 1/2 of one. Food went fine. When he brought my credit card back to me with the receipts to sign, he said they had a waitlist and could we please leave in 10 minutes. That had never happened to me before- if anything, I've been told an hour in advance that a restaurant was having a busy night. We were all pretty shocked, especially since there was no one waiting in the lobby area. Because we had a big enough party tip was added for me, and we were so unnerved that we left quickly after. As we were all gathering our stuff and making our way away from the table he was watching us- I assume to clean up the table as soon as the last person walked away. All in all, food was good but service was not- coming from someone's who's worked in a restaurant before.",2,
Brigid B.,27/03/23,,,,3,Went here for tacos and drinks. Reasonably priced and cheap drinks. Sports bar vibe with good service- not authentic food. Tacos seemed to have the same elements with different meats. Papas bravas were good but I don't recommend the brisket tacos.,15,

Lexi J.,15/04/23,1,,1,5,"I absolutely LOVE this place! I haven't had it since the RVA location closed in 2020. The food is always on point! Flavorful and reasonably priced. We did order fish tacos that could've used more fish, but the flavor was still good. The wings are smoked then seasoned and they are seasoned well! The cheesesteak egg rolls are my fave! The queso dipping sauce that they're served with just adds to to the ""yumminess"". And the Cajun fries..... omg!!  Definitely a ""do not share dish""! I usually don't like spicy, but these aren't overly spicy. Just the right amount of kick at the end. Our service wasn't anything to rave about. We got what we needed when we needed it. Also, most of the staff are students, so I don't hold anything against them. It's a little loud inside, but overall a great environment. You don't have to yell to talk, but you definitely have to elevate your voice just a little. Normal bar things.
I will definitely be taking that hour or so drive to visit again!",284,65

It was marg Monday and half off boneless wings and the restaurant ran out after delivering half the tables wings. The rest of us had our orders taken off and had to reorder, no discount on regular wings was offered even when asked. Following this our food came out probably another 25 minutes after our reorder. After eating, we were asked to wrap things up with our party due to a waiting list after having to split up our single check 10 ways after waiting for the check for 10 mins on its own, while actively splitting up the check. Ridiculous.",8,
Kaitlin T.,27/05/23,,1,1,4,"Asado is a great local choice in a fun part of town! Their tacos and wings (yes, strange combo but so worth it) are very tasty. They also have unique menu options like cheese steak egg rolls. Can't miss marg Monday!",9,101

Emily H.,23/11/23,,,,4,"Asados is a restaurant that I miss after a while. Ive been here many times and they were always reliable. My must get is the lemon pepper chicken wings because it is so flavorful but this time I felt that the seasoning was a little lacking. I tried the loaded Cajun fries for the first time and I expected it to have more toppings such as pico de gallo but it was really good! The Baja fish tacos is reliable and I always get it fried. I also tried the double smoked bacon and chicken for the first time and it was really delicious. I was pleasantly surprised. I'd still come here but I do feel that the quality went down a bit. The service is good, despite it always being busy when I come. I sat outside this time and they do have heaters so it wasn't too bad. Also if you get a drink get the frozen margarita with the sour patch rim. They've only had the sour patch rim once out of all the times I've been here and this time they didn't have frozen margaritas so it is a hit or miss.",74,5

The bartender Brenn was immediately attentive with water and told me about their half off wing menu. I ordered a beer and got two recommendations for bone in wings. 

Two baskets of hot wings hit within 10 minutes. They offer blue cheese or ranch. I had six Pineapple teriyaki and six honey barbecue. I was blown away with the size and how tasty! Brenn followed up with another beer order and could not resist another basket of wings.

Emma E.,19/07/24,,,,4,"Asados is on the UVA corner, so expect the place to cater and to be staffed by college students. That said, they are no slackers when it comes to food. I consistently think their wings are some of the better ones in cville and their Mexican is good.

There is a bar inside and they do drink specials regularly, so expect a bar environment inside. Overall, if I have a craving for smoked brisket (their tacos are awesome) or wings, this spot does the job.",249,18

Chloe L.,15/08/24,,,,1,"Recently, we have visited this establishment when we were greeted by the nice host to get a to go order which we later got sat at the bar to wait for our food with the nice bartender who asked if we wanted any drinks while we waited.    The wait was pleasingly short, even though it was very crowded. However, when we got back with our food, we were very disappointed with what we received. We had ordered two orders of boneless wings which had seemed like they had been in a fryer all day. They were VERY burnt and unpleasant to eat, we couldn't even finish them because of how hard and burnt they were. The price seemed very high for what we were served. We also got a side order of carrots and celery which were fresh, however they were very chewy. We both felt not very great after eating this meal and probably wouldn't re-order what we got. Staff overall was very sweet but food was not good.",12,

Arisnoe L.,11/12/24,,,,2,"Worst service ever! Went for wing Wednesday, we had multiple servers who both messed up our orders, and then they said they would fix our drinks but never did. Instead of serving us or fixing our issue the servers were on their phone and talking to one another, while ignoring our table. Food took forever, and the wings were dry and tasted like they were microwaved. I've been here multiple times and the food is okay at best, but it's expensive if you don't go during a day where they have a deal. Drinks are either way too light or way too heavy, and super expensive for what you get. Glorified bar food with the same prices as DC (mid at best), overpriced Margaritas, and pretty terrible service. Would not recommend even on wing Wednesday or margarita Monday. If you're looking for something similar either go to El Barco (for Margs) or Bebedero for food. This has the worst of both worlds. The only thing that saves it from 1 star is the location.",1,
