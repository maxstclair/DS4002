Recently they allowed us a private dining area, it's literally a separate building that houses many of the local wines they serve, intimate but spacious enough for up to 40 people comfortably. 

They allowed my friends to select a set menu with a variety of options for only $50 per person, this did not include alcohol. For a four course meal the price and good was great. The mushroom risotto was amazing as was the lobster macaroni and cheese for starters! The salad was even great and I'm pretty indifferent to most Restaurants house salads. The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned well, I'm a MD girl so the crab cakes were just ok to me. The desserts were yummy as well.

Relative to other restaurants in Charlottesville, I think the Local has the best pricing for awesome food. - all in all, a PERFECT semi-formal DATE SPOT. Even affordable for a college student trying to do something a bit more fancy for a night.

FOOD: fresh and sourced locally! Hence this place's name. I think they've truly perfected the flavors here. Of what I've tried, the pork chops are great as are the roasted cauliflower and their steak. Their berry cobbler dessert is delicious as well. The fact that I've been here 3 times and have enjoyed my dishes every single time gives this place a 100% in my books.

SERVICE: So kind and so knowledgeable! I forget my servers name but everyone around us commented how awesome he was and their desire to tip him well. - white guy with brown curly hair!

AMBIANCE: Cute, cozy, and also great outdoor seating if you so wish. Their back area has a cool painting of birds as well.

Honestly 10/10, if you need a consistently great, semi fancy date night place TAKE HIM/HER HERE.",15,666,wdZ830KE1cD1W_mILrR5_Q,"Centreville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=wdZ830KE1cD1W_mILrR5_Q,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/9yPYvKSh2TI6QU_Bd_kH7w/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-local-charlottesville?hrid=

It is definitely consistently high quality food that always leaves me feeling full and happy. I've had everything from the trout and burgers to steak and short ribs and food is always hot, fresh, and very well seasoned and flavored. 

One of the best things about this place is that there is so much ample space! It's absolutely great for large, large parties and there a ton of starter platters that can be made to share. 

It's a bit pricey to be eating here regularly, and the semi-formal vibe makes it difficult to justify as an easy option for dinner. The location away from UVA grounds also makes it a slight inconvenience to get to if you don't have a car, but it's a great place to bring guests as a solid introduction to the Charlottesville food scene!",94,213,_EYEbSSt_fnQ1mRNcaw59A,"Charlottesville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_EYEbSSt_fnQ1mRNcaw59A,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/csf2fvINiKC9UxjC5ss2GA/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-local-charlottesville?hrid=

I had a house salad which was unique with pickles onions and an Asian flair, and the salmon, which was baller. The big cous cous was delicious and the green beans were flavored well too.

The presentation kind of looked like it was just thrown together on the plate, but keeping 5 stars for the great service and not having to wait very long at all for our large party (there were about 15 of us).",148,15,Ofjmtygn_MuO6kn5ahuZYw,"Richmond, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Ofjmtygn_MuO6kn5ahuZYw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/DRwrEiAU-EkLUhVgCjKqVw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-local-charlottesville?hrid=

The food and wine were delicious. Our table split a bottle of Pinot Noir. I ordered my usual, the Truffled Mushroom Ragout (Sharondale Farms shiitake, crimini, and oyster mushrooms, white truffle oil, and parmesan cheese, tossed with fresh house made fettuccine). It was yummy as usual! 

The only reason I'm deducting a star is because our waitress acted super weird when the majority of us ordered pasta instead of entrees. She goes ""you guys and your pasta!

Nothing but praise for the Local, its ambiance and decor is this rustic feel that feels formal but also homely. The food here is art. The pasta is clearly freshly made and the meat quality here isn't gamey or dry. 

I've been here two times, the first being on a date. We both ordered pasta and it didn't disappoint. The second time being here was my birthday. The fries that came with my father's steak were delicious (I began to poach them after my meal was finished) and I personally got the glazed pork chops, which came out succulent and delicious.

8,,"Leah G.","2019-03-28 21:18:08",1,0,0,2,5,"I've been here at least 2-3 times for special occasions (valentine's day, double dates, etc.) and it's been amazing every time! Each time I've gone, I've made a reservation on Open Table and was seated right away. I definitely recommend making a reservation if you're going from Friday to Sunday.

Atmosphere - I love the ambiance. The downstairs is sort of a classic wooden rustic bar area, and the upstairs is more of an open concept fancier restaurant with twinkle lights. If you have any family or friends visiting from out of town, this is a perfect place to take them for a nice, but casual night out with dinner and drinks.

Service - The service has always been super quick and the wait staff is extremely attentive, even when it's a busy Friday or weekend night.

Parking - There's not much parking in front, but there is a neighborhood on the parallel street over with ample amounts of street parking.

Most importantly, FOOD - I'm not a vegetarian, but I don't eat much meat. I LOVE their Truffled Mushroom Ragout. It's so creamy and rich without being too heavy. I usually get the double/larger portion so that I can take it home and have it for leftovers the next day for lunch! My friends have ordered the salmon, the burger, or the steak with rave reviews as well.

10,,"Owen B.","2019-05-03 10:00:04",1,1,1,2,4,"3.5/5 stars.  Solid dinner but some misses along the way.  I will say that for the price, the food is excellent. The Local reminded us of many of the higher end places around town (Oakhardt, Duners, Orzo, etc), except the food was certainly a small step down from those place BUT the prices were also noticeably lower.  Cheaper 'date night' prices, pretty solid food, super close and convenient.... overall Local is worth trying out. 

We followed the waiter's recommendations and got the crispy shrimp and flash-fried sprouts as apps.  Shrimp were something you can find anywhere (i.e. bonefish) but the fried sprouts were pretty tasty.  For dinner I had the fried local chicken and she had the salmon.  Her fish was good, but the underlying rice was super goopy and tasted like it was cooked in a crockpot with canned cream'o mushroom soup. My chicken had some excellent flavor but the bulk of my meat portion was just fried chicken skin with minimal actual meat. We also had a side of Gus but with only 6 spears for $6... you'll want to skip those. Lastly, our server was friendly but kinda hard to understand b/c he worked&talked at the speed of light.

The atmosphere is rustic while refined, and offers a beautiful selection of wine bars and an outdoor semi-covered rooftop terrace under string lights.

12,,"Becca M.","2019-09-10 00:16:16",1,0,0,1,5,"The Local gives a taste of the best parts of Charlottesville. This Belmont spot is a great spot to take a first date, friends from out of town, or just anyone who likes a good meal. I have been twice and each time I've gotten with different people and we've all enjoyed the experience.

The staff is friendly, attentive, and they make great recommendations. We were unsure on which wine to split and our waiter spoke openly about which was what we were looking for without clearly encouraging us to only go for the most expensive bottles.

The top deck has great string lights which makes for a great atmosphere. Inside cleanliness and decor are top notch. They find a great mix of casual and formal. Wearing a dress or wearing jeans and a nice top both work for the atmosphere.

The food. That alone earns the five stars. The lobster Mac and cheese came highly recommended and when I say they don't skimp they definitely don't. I split a dinner portion with my friend and we still couldn't finish it all. It comes topped with cheese and such large chunks of lobster we found ourselves cutting it into smaller portions so we could enjoy more noodles. Another friend ordered the steak frites and the portion size was amazing. The best part about all our selections despite the large size the flavor was there. Our cocktails were delightful strong but not overwhelming. We ordered a banana split with there house made ice cream. It was delicious and definitely a shareable dessert.

One friend I've gone with is vegan and our waiter recommended the local roasted squash without cheese and we all ended up nibbling it because it was delicious!

The restaurant was in a quaint part of town. Walking in to the restaurant you will notice local artwork and on the tables were these elegant glass candles. Almost looked as though they were handmade. 

We enjoyed the crab soup. It was a tomato based soup filled with plenty of crab. The Brussels and Cauliflower lightly seasoned and crispy, laid over a sirachi mayo sauce. Highly recommend them as an appetizer! 

My crab cakes and asparagus were a great choice. Highly recommended and would order again. I could do without the coleslaw!

The second time was actually better than the first. They didn't have any tables but we sat at the bar which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. The bartender was absolutely amazing. He's very attentive even with having a bar full of customers. My boyfriend ended up not liking his drink, and he was super observant of this and offered him another drink So that my boyfriend had a drink that he enjoyed with his dinner.

17,,"Nishika R.","2020-03-02 18:05:31",0,1,1,1,4,"After looking into a few restaurants for my friend's birthday dinner in Charlottesville, we decided on The Local. When you walk in, you were welcomed into a restaurant with a cozy and calm ambience, complimented with a wooden floor and brick wall interior to create a ""homey feeling."" We were seated upstairs, which ended up being more spacious than we expected. For a Saturday night, this place was packed. It seemed to be a more family oriented restaurant based on the patrons this evening.

For the food, we decided to split the Fried Brussels and Cauliflower. Although the waitress recommended we get two, one plate was more than enough for the five of us. The cauliflower was cooked to perfection, but the brussels were not as tender as I expected. Also, there was flavor in this starter, I think there needed to be a counterpoint to it given it was just had a sharp tangy taste that lacked any sort of spice. 

Our entree orders: The Ceasar Salad was fairly standard, but the Goat Cheese salad was the perfect mix of ingredients created a sweet yet savory salad experience. Both had the right amount of dressing to not oversaturate the greens. Amazing pick. Another great option was the Gnocchi Bolognese. The gnocchi were melt in your mouth pillows saturated in a creamy meat sauce. The Truffle Mushroom Ragout was also drenched in creamy flavor, although it was a little bland (but to be expected based on the simple ingredients). The Veggie Burger, also fairly delicious, came with a whole appetizer size portion of burrata- it was incredible. The Duck Breast was incredibly succelent, and the only issue was that of the appetizier- the lack of tenderness in the brussel sprouts. 

As a tip, a couple of us just got the salads and a half portion of pasta thinking we might still be hungry, but honestly this amount was plenty and very cost effective.

All in all, you really get what you paid for here, as we all had some leftover food but were pretty stuffed towards the end of the meal. The waiters were attentive and helpful as well since we were new to the area/ restaurant and had a few questions while ordering. But, for the food, nothing really reinvented the wheel, but everything we got was solid so I have no complaints whatsoever.",122,622,1UkLhGJQ8qQgubUmPjRHCw,"Charlotte, NC",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1UkLhGJQ8qQgubUmPjRHCw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/8CeD70gGJmiiya7hVHMdwQ/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-local-charlottesville?hrid=

The curbside set up is well-run - you call when you drive up and someone with gloves and mask will drop it into your car. 

Our favorite has been the mushroom pasta (we ordered it twice!); it is a nice blend of savory, buttery goodness. The fried chicken was not too heavily breaded, and the grilled hamburger steak was just a tad bit too salty for me. The 2 dishes came with mashed potatoes and green beans.

The restaurant consists of two floors and has nice outdoor seating on both. The inside of the restaurant has a cozy atmosphere with warm lighting and exposed brick. I also love how the interior supports local artist's paintings and stain glass works.

We ordered Crispy Shrimp Appetizer, Sauvignon Blanc, Meatloaf, Gnocchi Bolognese, and House Made Blackberry Cobbler. The Crispy Shrimp was lightly fried, cooked well, and tasted great in the sauces. The seaweed salad that came with it also complimented the dish nicely.

The Gnocchi was perfectly cooked and had a nice bite to it. The sauce was hearty, and the overall dish was delicious. The Meatloaf was awesome. The bacon was a nice touch, and it was one of the best meatloafs I've ever had. The mashed potatoes and green beans were also cooked well. It's a great meat and potatoes dish. The entrees we ordered were 17 dollars each and I thought the portions and quality were great for the price.

For dessert, we tried the House Made Blackberry Cobbler. It was probably the most underwhelming order of the night; however, it wasn't bad. I would have liked a nicer crust on the top and bottom because I couldn't really find any crust. I also would have liked the blackberry filling to be thicker because the consistency was more on the liquid side with solid pieces of blackberry sitting inside. However, I thought the vanilla ice cream was good and it was freshly made which I liked.

Overall, I enjoyed my food and dining experience here. I love how The Local embodies their namesake as a locally owned business that sources ingredients from locally owned and operated farms, and even showcases local artists in their restaurant design.

Being from Florida, I wasn't quite sure about ordering all seafood at an inland location, but the restaurant really delivered a delicious meal. The shrimp is fried in a light batter and the salmon has a wonderful crust. Overcooked seafood can be so disappointing, but the salmon was cooked perfectly. The fish flaked while still having moisture, a perfect medium rare salmon, just the way I like it. Salmon is such a wonderful fish, but over cooking it just a bit can transform its flavor from being delicate to very fishy and strong. So kudos to the chef, because not only was my piece cooked perfectly, so was the second order I took home . The restaurant is cozy and has a lot of outdoor seating, mostly shaded. Definitely going to be a regular spot for me in the coming years. A good place to go when family comes to visit!

The Food:
*.38 Cocktail - I love whiskey and old fashioned's and this one certainly impressed. I'm not a fan of ginger (one of the ingredients), but whatever they did with this drink it certainly worked. Highly recommended.

*crispy shrimp - great and tasty appetizer. If you love Asian food and flavors, then you'll likely love this one. The seaweed salad was unexpectedly very tasty.

*pork belly - This was good and had plenty of flavor but I'd warn anyone who isn't a fan of meat with a fatty cut. There was a bit too much for my wife's liking but we still enjoyed it.

*Buffalo Creek Beef short ribs - Loved it and it's as good as everyone says it is. Tender, flavorful, and filling! If you are considering it, go ahead and order it. 

*Tenderloin - This was an item on the special menu that night and my wife enjoyed every bite. The portion size was also impressive and she was defeated by it.

Sat at the bar and had a bean dish topped with an egg and what I believe was a Cajun style sausage. It was delicious! It had some spices I couldn't quite identify but it was really good.

The carrots may have been the best I ever tried! They were grilled with some type of nut and a thin sauce that was delicious. Also very pretty multi colors of carrots. If you come here you have to try them.

Service was attentive and friendly- I was alone so I ate at the bar.

The only downside is that the wine was a little disappointing- I wish I would have went with beer as it appeared they had a much better selection.

They also have a very extensive selection of mixed drinks and spirits. I tried an old fashioned but I was also a little disappointed with that. The bartender noticed and didn't charge me. Even so, this is an expensive place if you drink, although I thought the food was reasonable for the area.

The Low Down:

Call ahead early for a reservation. The tables on the front right side are going to be close to the host or hostess. Try to sit closer towards the back or over to the left to avoid hearing their conversations with guests during your dinner.

The food: it's made with locally grown produce and is very fresh.

The portions were incredibly small for the set price that doesn't even include drinks. The steak was extremely well done and unseasoned despite the sauce on top that was bitter.

98,,"Emma E.","2023-11-27 06:33:11",0,0,0,1,3,"Eh.  Certainly not the worst dinner I've had but when the Local stacks up against other New American fare in Charlottesville it doesn't quite hold up in comparison. 3/5

TLDR the food is fine but not the best I've had here. If you're looking for ~$20 per person entrees for a decent night out you'll find it, but better and similar fare can be found at other spots around town.

The service and the ambiance are both good, it's very cute inside and old wood and bricks. The building is historic and it's well curated with local art. Tables are far too close together we were basically sitting on top of the people behind us and that was uncomfortable. Dining room was way too cold in the winter -bring a jacket.

The start we had a cheese and fruit plate. The cheese was pretty boring IMO - Brie, smoked Gouda, and then two white cheeses probably a cheddar and Parmesan. Fruit was grapes and apples. Good, but again kind of just meh.

For entrees, we had two pasta dishes at our table and two meat entrees. I had the shrimp carbonara, my friend had the truffle mushroom linguine, my boyfriend had the meatloaf (recommended by our server) and my friends boyfriend had the steak. All of us felt very meh - there was no standout dish everything was kind of just meh.

My shrimp carbonara was okay, the pasta was the star. It was perfectly cooked and the pasta tasted handmade. The shrimp half was tail on half was tail off and it felt cooked unevenly - some pieces were cooked too long and super curled and rubbery, some pieces were juicier. The sauce was a letdown - for a carbonara, this was like eating cheese water. Thin and very little flavor. I did not finish it and didn't bother taking more home. Not the best pasta in Charlottesville. This was the second dish our server recommended.

My boyfriend had the first recommended dish by our server, the meatloaf. It was wrapped in bacon atop mashed potato's and green beans. He said the green beans were slightly undercooked without much flavor but the mashed potato's were good. Meatloaf was good but could've used more sauce.

My friends mushroom pasta smelled delicious - she had similar takeaways about her pasta that I did of mine. Good pasta, but lacking in some flavor and thin sauce. Good, but not great.

Her boyfriend ordered a medium steak and this was definitely a disappointment. Let's just be honest - this steak was rare. He said the sides were good but the steak being undercooked and under seasoned was a let down considering it was a pricier item.

Beer was good, selection is decent.

Dessert was good we had peanut butter brownie w ice cream and a pecan pie. Very average but still good.

Overall I didn't feel like anything really stood out to me except the prices - C&O, Orzo and the Ridley, even Mockingbird all kinda have similar fare to the Local with some minor variations but all do a better job than the local with everything except price. Everywhere else charges about $30+ per person so I was happy we paid a little less but would've been willing to pay more for better food.

Overall the local is good but not great - personally Charlottesville restaurant scene is so competitive I would probably look elsewhere in the future for New American fare.",249,18,B4SrTn091R69TqlyywI-5A,"Charlottesville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=B4SrTn091R69TqlyywI-5A,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/4NHOOek-ZvGaxaGeEL6Vxw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-local-charlottesville?hrid=

Early reservations got us a table in a satellite space next to the main dining room, which looks like their wine cellar. Bare brick and wine bins were the vibe, with a server station tucked away in a corner. Tables were a little tight, which makes the place cacophonous when there's a large well-served six-top seated in the corner (ask me how we found out).

The menu was comfort-heavy from an entree standpoint (everyone ordered either steak frites or the braised short ribs, although there were three different gnocchi offerings). The apps were equally easy to choose from: we grabbed a cheese plate and the burrata caprese salad. The cheeses were fine, four large cubes of various white cheeses and a little round ball of chèvre. Plenty of grapes, cut apples, and box crackers made this a decent little appetizer value for four. The caprese offering was a great way to bring forth the current burrata trend by plating it on top of large sliced tomatoes over arugula, with a lace of a balsamic reduction all over the top.

The steak frites was passable, fries served on the side in a little bistro basket. The steak was played on top of a horseradish-artichoke bechamel  (I was so stoked for this, but alas, literally, weak sauce: thin, no sense of horseradish bite at all). To be fair: not sure if this is a case of incorrect expectation versus execution. It wasn't bad, just not sure what I got. The short rib was a nice long-braised short rib over a decent mashed potatoes: easy, accessible.

The wine list at the Local is simply lovely. We were seated right beside all of the several vintages of Stag's Leap: they are not playing around when it comes to wine. The by-the-glass list is simple, accessible, and affordable. 

All in all, the Local fit the bill for a family dinner out. It's comfortable food and wine that hits the table really quickly (we were in and out in less than an hour), and has something for everyone.",115,125,zT0P7r_WPjEn0muUxen6MA,"Oxford, NC",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zT0P7r_WPjEn0muUxen6MA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/gTcHtSDWWcHzluX6-N2B3w/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-local-charlottesville?hrid=

The server told us over but they gladly honored the price of our wine.  The food was good - pictured is what I had.  The salad was good (maybe a few too many fried wontons) but nice flavor and not overdressed.  The rockfish was delicious but strangely served in a bowl which made it virtuously impossible to eat - cutting it became impossible and I had to ask for a plate.  They brought me a tiny side plate which didn't improve matters much.  Everyone else enjoyed their entrees  - crab soup, buratta special, steak frites, meatloaf, and fried gnocchi with scallops.

For meals we all had a variety of things, but I had the short ribs the first night and the salmon the second night - each tasty, and a nice portion size.
