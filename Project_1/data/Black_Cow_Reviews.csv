Valerie R.,19/02/23,,,,5,"This place was better than the 3 Michelin-star restaurant I ate at in NYC last week (not naming names). They've only been open only 3 days and already seem to have everything on lock. We had an ""early bird special"" reservation at 5PM on a Saturday and were greeted by a lovely host and seated immediately. I'm pretty sure the Guardians of the Galaxy station was what was playing on the speakers (that alone gives extra points ;)). Our server, Zoe, was perfectly attentive and super knowledgeable about the available cuts of meats. The menu was very diverse for the entrees however the only gripe I have is that the starters were limited. We ordered the roasted oysters to start and OMG the BEST roasted oysters I've ever had. They were cooked to perfection and super tender. My husband and I shared the ribeye and ordered the Raymond Sauce and Chimichurri for side sauces. We loved both so much that we're still in the octagon to decide the winner ;). The ribeye was amazingly flavorful, and the sauces were a lovely accouterment but seriously not even needed due to the quality of the meat and the perfection of the cooking/seasoning. The steak comes with a house salad and baguette that arrives before your entree. We also ordered the creamed spinach which was another ""best"". Seriously. Not too creamy/heavy, just overall DELICIOUS. Our server was the perfect amount of checking in and making suggestions. Oh and did I mention they have a super knowledgeable sommelier and a delightful wine list. We also ordered dessert with the french press coffee. I'm not a dessert person, but the lemon pie was chef's kiss.  

All in all, we will definitely be back and can't wait to try all the other delicious sounding items on the menu.",82,100
Linda D.,19/02/23,,,,5,"I have to say, this place is a steakhouse like no other, best beef and my bone in pork chop and sauce was fabulous. We sat up at the bar and Danny & Emily took care of us at every beckon request. I do feel that this place is a diamond in the rough, it should be the place for beef, pork & chicken. Love the atmosphere, staff, cooks & owner Dan! Thank you!",113,56
Ingrid F.,26/02/23,,,1,5,"Loved this place! They were completely booked but they squeezed us in in the lounge. Thank you! This restaurant was just what we were looking for on our short visit from CA.
Steak was awesome. Shared the Chateaubriand and my son had the ribeye (both with butter on top.) steaks came with dinner salad and sourdough bread.
Mashers were super rich and delicious. Brussels sprouts were crispy and flavorful.  Desserts- lemon pie (like a lemon square as it had shortbread crust), vanilla ice cream and chocolate mousse (if you like dark chocolate) all were awesome too.  Service was excellent.
Make a reservation in advance.",28,28
Henry C.,05/03/23,,,,4,"Food is excellent, best steak in a very long time. Service was excellent, attentive, helpful but not overbearing.  Ambiance was eating in a very loud garage, so only reason it was not a solid 5 star.",24,
Em M.,08/03/23,,,,5,"The food here is incredible! The service was extremely friendly and helpful. We felt right at home and very well accommodated. 

I will say, the height of the booths along the back wall is *extremely* uncomfortable and overall, fairly inaccessible if one has any sort of limitation mobility-wise. Initially we were seated there. The tables were awkwardly high for the height of the seats (which was already not great), and the edge of the table was up to my chest which made it hard to comfortably eat. However, our server was able to move us into a normal height table when he saw that all of the people in our party were struggling. Another thing to note is that the restaurant is fairly loud. This didn't bother me much, but I can imagine that if one is sensitive to that it could be bothersome. Just something to note if one is seeking a quieter dining experience. This place is full of life!

The food was AMAZING. Delicious wood fired oysters, steaks with flavor-packed compound butter and optional sauces, delightfully crispy fries, and perfectly cooked vegetables. The drinks were delightful as well. I thoroughly look forward to coming back!!",23,1
Jennifer M.,19/03/23,,,,5,"Wow! Mouth watering steak (excuse the spilled Bernaise sauce). Tender, perfectly cooked filet. Others at the rib end tomahawk, Berkshire pork chop, and New York strip.  No one shared because our meals were too good! For wides we did mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and Brussels sprouts.  The creamed spinach was gone.  The Brussels sprouts were the kind you think about the next day and crave.  The potatoes were good. Extensive wine list and full bar.  Everything is a La carte though so it added up.  Entrees come with a salad but no other sides.  There's also bread service.  10/10 highly recommend if you're looking for a nice night out.  The food is delicious!!!!",165,26
Min O.,22/03/23,,,,5,"If you plan to dine in for dinner, make sure to make a reservation! It is a beautifully designed space, perfect for a casual meal or a special occasion dinner. Delicious beef tartare and walnut old fashioned!",15,168
Mae C.,23/03/23,,,,5,The food was absolutely delicious. I had a perfectly cooked ribeye with the chimichuri sauce and the truffle mac and cheese. It was fantastic! I'd also recommend the cocktails (Smoky Dove with jalapeno salt ring! Yum!) The happy hour was a great price for all that deliciousness..,2,
George O.,29/03/23,,,,5,Five represents excellent service & food! The old service station has great warm weather seating outside but it was still spring cool and we ate inside. The service was excellent and the food was great--great burgers with local beef and salad or fries. Even better steak plates ...our group had two burgers and two steak plates--outstanding local beef as good as it is going to get on this planet if one eats meat.,1,
Elizabeth E.,08/04/23,2,,3,4,"Good, but still not the best steak in town. 

Stopped in here for an early dinner. Both my fiancé and I ordered the Steak Frites from the Happy Hour Menu. I added the salad with the cherry vinaigrette to mine. The salad was really good! Not sweet, a nice flavor. They had also brought us bread and that was good as well. 

For drinks, my fiancé got the Walnut Old Fashioned. It was very sweet, which the waiter had warned us about, but we both agreed it would have made a better dessert drink than meal drink. I had a couple glasses of the Malbec which was really nice. 

The steak frites were good. The fries were excellent, and fries aren't usually something I notice, so well done! The steaks themselves were great, but not the best I've had in the Cville area (I think I'm still committed to South and Central). For the price, however, this place is amazing! Bearnaise sauce was thoroughly delicious.  

Our waiter was 10/10, and perhaps one of the best servers I've had in a long time, polite, charming, and knowledgeable. When there was a problem with my fiancés first drink (a lone bug had made a dive into it), he was able to comp it for 50% (totally fair because he had drunk half of it!!), and got my fiancé the classic old fashioned (which he ordered instead, and thought tasted better anyways). 

The ambiance was relaxed, a comfortable volume to have a private conversation, and cozy. The seating was comfortable as well. Cool to be able to see and smell the grill. I also LOVED the music (a nice mix of music from the 30s-60s). 

Overall, great vibes, great flavors and great values.",141,167
J W.,14/04/23,,,,5,"My daughter and I ate there
for the first time and loved it. Great steak, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Will definitely ately go back",6,
Brandon M.,15/04/23,,,,4,My eyes were definitely bigger than the stomach!! The portions are definitely shareable. Reserve early or go early. Definitely popular.,5,
Catherine X.,17/04/23,,,,4,Love this newly opened restaurant! I got the steak frites for the happy hour deal(highly recommend taking advantage of that) and holyy COW they were udder-ly delicious! The fries were crispy and seasoned well while the steak itself was terrifically tender. Our server was also really knowledgeable of the menu and the service was overall superb. Will definitely come back here to try more of the appetisers and the other cocktails!,38,26
Justin N.,23/04/23,,,,4,"Had a nice Sunday happy hour dinner here with friends. I ordered the Black Cow Steak Frites with the add-on Little Salad, and a glass of their happy hour featured red wine. The featured red wine was a Malbec. The chef's choice daily cut was a hanger steak with chimichurri sauce. I'm a simple guy--steak frites paired with a nice red and I'm happy. The salad was a nice fresh and tasty addition to the meal. One note that I have is that I preferred the hanger steak without the chimichurri sauce. I felt that the hanger steak was seasoned well already, and that the chimichurri muted some of the steak's already nicely developed flavors. The regular menu is pricy, but I enjoyed my happy hour experience here and thought it was a great deal. I guess you could say that happy hour at Black Cow was in fact happy.",372,109
Kendall C.,23/04/23,,,,5,We sat outside on the patio. It was a little chilly but they had heaters on the deck. The staff was all nice. The steaks were amazing.,402,18
Anne P.,01/05/23,,,,5,"5 stars. We have a group we call The Fifty Shades of Gravy Club. We go to a different restaurant the last Saturday of the month. This month we choose this place. When we called for a reservation for a party of 8, they couldn't get us seated together. However, we arrived at 4:30 and Daniel figured out where he could put two tables together as long as we promised to be done by 6:30. I said it would depend on if we got fast service, and boy did we! Our waiter was John. His second day on the job. He was a Wizard. We got happy hour drinks (can you imagine happy hour on a Saturday!) He described all the meats and told us which ones were flavorful but chewy, and which were tender. The sauces were extra. They were to die for. The meat entrees came with a salad that was lightly dressed with a homemade dressing of your choice. Most of the sides were family style and sooo good. I am doing a Keto diet so I was in heaven. The portions of the steak most of us order were huge. Two of the smart people among us shared theirs. I took my leftover home and had dinner again the next day. AND instead of handing me a box for my leftovers, John took my plate back to the kitchen and transferred my food into a styrofoam box that had parchment paper in it. Who does that anymore!?! It was great because I was able to transfer the food using the parchment paper instead of scraping it off the box. Everyone loved what they ordered. I will definitely return to this restaurant again. It is now my new favorite.",16,
Angela D.,07/05/23,,,,5,"This place is so great!! I love wood-fired meats, generally, and they have chosen quality vendors for them. Drinks, apps, salads, mains, lobster mac and cheese (best I've ever had!!), and dessert was perfect for my husband's (chef) birthday. It's nice to see a menu that is streamlined, straightforward, and executed perfectly in a restaurant that knows itself and it's customers. 

Being a new location, you expect some hiccups, but they really have nailed it with every aspect. They fill that space well. We can't wait to go back.",49,3
Robert T.,17/05/23,,,,5,"My new favorite spot in Charlottesville..!! The best Steaks, ambiance and service.

Forgot South and Central..! This place tops it by far..!",2,
Lisa D.,29/05/23,,,,5,"We were passing through Charlottesville and were looking for a good place for dinner.  We found the Black Cow and were really glad we chose this restaurant to eat at.  The service was fantastic, but the food is what we will remember most!  The smoked oysters are to die for, the truffle fries are the best we have ever had ANYWHERE, the burger was fantastic and the beet salad was amazing. This restaurant is new and I truly hope the locals support them so that we can keep coming back whenever we are in Charlottesville!",4,
Brandon B.,10/06/23,,,,5,"Big fan of Daniel Kaufman's eateries, and this is no exception. Delicious menu to eat through. You can spend a lot or spend a little (one great steak frites special), and the cocktail menu keeps you coming back for more. If you haven't been to Public Fish or Black Cow, do yourself a favor and get here pronto.",220,10
Shannon B.,11/06/23,,,,5,"We had a great dinner here for our anniversary! Once we were there, we learned the restaurant has only been open a few months. The steaks were cooked to perfection! Each entree comes with a side salad (which was large) of tender greens with thin sliced radish and cucumber. We had the Choice of their homemade ranch or vinaigrette, which were both tasty. We had the steak tartar for an appetizer and it was on point!! I had the filet mignon and my husband the Chateubriand  and they were both cooked to perfection. My filet was like butter. You have several choices of toppings for your steak, if you wish. My husband got the béarnaise sauce and it was very light and tasty. Each steak also comes with a yummy roasted pearl onion/garlic side. We share the creamed spinach for a side and it was delicious! The key lime pie is probably better then the key lime pie we had in the Keys! Tart and sweet but not too sweet. Our server was very nice and informative and knew the menu well and gave good recommendations- which we appreciate. We would definitely recommend this place and we will return when we visit Cville in the future.",13,1
Lois F.,13/06/23,,,,5,Superb!! Service was great. Everyone was very helpful navigating the menu. The food was fantastic with the exception of the Brussel sprouts which were almost burnt in my opinion. The drinks were very good with creative presentations. Our family enjoyed ourselves immensely. Will be back!,6,
Bradley M.,27/06/23,,,,5,Their Ny Strip is one of the best steaks I've ever had. Service was excellent and after dinner drinks at the bar were on point. Excellent high end bourbon selection as well.  Looking forward to making this my go to restaurant when visiting C'Ville.,2,
Brian T.,02/07/23,,,,5,"REVISED REVIEW: The owner went above and beyond to rectify a bad experience. After returning home to Massachusetts from our engagement vacation, we received an unexpected gift of champagne. Daniel Kaufman is a stand up person who will do anything for his patrons. My fiancée and I look forward to returning to this restaurant!",6,9
Michael M.,05/07/23,,,,5,"This past weekend we ate at Black Cow Chophouse and I enjoyed one of the best meals I've ever had! 

We had their special mezcal cocktail to start then ordered the buttermilk fried oysters for an appetizer. I love fried oysters but these were were absolutely fantastic. 

All of the mains come with a fresh green salad with a choice of housemade dressings.  I got the fresh greens with vinaigrette dressing and while everyone makes a vinaigrette this one was exceptionally tasty.

We shared the bone in ribeye steak and an order of crab cakes for our main meal. 

The steak was delicious on its own but we added a few sauces including bearnaise sauce, peppercorn cream with cognac sauce and the horseradish sauce all of which were wonderful and pretty much pushed the steak over the top. 

The crab cakes had huge pieces of pure lump crabmeat combined with fresh seasonings, served with a light aioli so the flavor of the crabmeat really came through. 

We also ordered sides of smashed potatoes, fried brussel sprouts and fresh grilled zucchini. The potatoes were cooked so they were soft on the inside but had a slight crunch when you bit into them. They were topped with a light chimichurri sauce that made an amazing dish even better.  I'm not a brussel sprouts fan but the fried brussel sprouts were fantastic, light and slightly crisp so they would just melt in your mouth. I couldn't stop eating them! Then, I really wasn't expecting anything from the zucchini but again I was surprised by a dish that was lightly seasoned and cooked perfectly so it really provided a great balance to the meal. For dessert we shared the key lime pie and the chocolate mousse with sea salt and again, both dishes were fantastic - the key lime pie is now my favorite dessert of all time.

The staff were extremely attentive and delivered fantastic service. Our server did a great job covering the restaurants approach to food and service and helped guide us through the menu making excellent suggestions for wines, appetizers and our dinner selection.

The ambiance is fun and engaging vs. formal and stuffy which makes the whole experience at Black Cow Chophouse even more enjoyable.",3,
Sarah J.,08/07/23,,,,5,"My husband and I had an amazing anniversary dinner here this evening. From the spectacular service to the delicious food, so, so good. I wanted to try something different and had the bavette. SO. GLAD. I. DID. I had it with the chimichurri, but honestly, it didn't need it. I found myself going to the confit garlic on the side even more than the chimichurri, which was good by the way. That garlic though, I am going to need to learn how to make that at home. The smashed red potatoes were killer. We told our waiter we just wanted potatoes as a side, and for him to choose. Solid choice he made for us!",28,40
Smash G.,13/07/23,,,,5,"Tonight was a great night came in from Los Angeles to visit some family that have relocated.

Got a massive meal 5 apps, everyone got steaks,etc.

My steak was a bit undercooked while all the rest were perfect. I didn't even say anything but server could tell I wasn't pleased and rectified the situation very swiftly.

All in all we left full and the deserts were great.

Appreciate tier one level service and food on a Friday night in a small town!",51,406
Kramer R.,05/08/23,,,,4,"Food was impeccable. We had a type of cut I had the Bavette, which I was excited to try and had never had before. Sides were also great. And while we sat outside and it was hot as you know what, it was manageable. The interior design is impressive and I'd return to eat inside. 

This place gets an additional star with an attitude adjustment. Pretentiuos hostess and pretentious, disinterested, gloomy server. 
I get it, everyone has a bad day. But put on your game-face for a few hours and smile at your customer.  We are an engaging fam...we are not pretentious and generally look for and bring positive mojo.  Perhaps it is just C-ville...but I doubt it.  #smile, please.",27,
Courtney W.,14/08/23,1,1,2,5,"An absolutely wonderful visit to the neighborhood couldn't have ended better than a late night dinner here. Our server was so helpful and polite - and the food was absolutely amazing! We both went with a filet mignon and shared the lobster Mac n cheese- oh wow, could not have had a better choice if we had tried! We went with a beautiful bottle of red which we were able to cork and take the remainder home- necessary after starting with some perfectly dirty martinis. Cannot wait to come back!",627,372
Mark A.,18/08/23,,,,5,"Food prepared with care and precision. Tasty, creative, with communal atmosphere. Accommodating kitchen and servers.",6,
Karen S.,25/08/23,,,,5,"I took my husband there to celebrate his birthday.  From the moment we walked in our experience was flawless.  The hostess was great (changed our table so we were not sitting right next to 2 infants), our waitress, Kat was terrific and knowledgeable and had awesome recommendations.   The food was exquisite and I never say that.  My husbands chateaubriand was heaven, my crab cakes Devine and the sides did not disappoint.  The desserts just put the entire experience over the top.  We will definitely be back!",1,
Ellie S.,25/08/23,,,,5,"Phenomenal food! We were in the area visiting Monticello and stopped in for dinner. Every steak was delicious and we tried five. The happy hour meal was such a great deal-- so delicious. We loved the lobster Mac and cheese, the mashed potatoes were so good. Wish we could have stayed for dessert!",59,75
Lynn R.,05/09/23,,,,5,One of my favorite places to dine. The beef is fantastic Excellent service Loved the down to earth atmosphere Can't wait to go back,7,65
Vivian Z.,07/09/23,,,1,5,"Really great place! Pretty interiors, busy bar, quick crowd. Friendly accommodating service. I ordered their drink special which was the pineapple fin- a really refreshing pineapple-infused finlandia vodka. Wish it was chilled a bit more but I really appreciated the big chunk of pineapple. I was worried it might be too sweet and ""juice"" tasting but I could really tell the cocktail was just infused (30 days, apparently!)

For food I started with the sherry vinaigrette salad. Simple mixed greens but the greens were super tender and fresh. Dressing was light, the added pickled onions and fine shredded parmesan were great. I got the bavette steak cooked medium, with side sauces of the peppercorn and the chimichurri. The steak had a great sear, came out more on the medium rare side and a tad salty, but the beef flavor was great. Also tried the creamed spinach and whipped potatoes which were so comforting and delicious, the potatoes were SO dangerously buttery and creamy. We also tried the belgian fries which were underwhelming- dry, felt a bit stale to me, no flavor. They are apparently featured as a specialty (double fried and all that) but reminded me of In-n-Out's anticlimactic fries. 

For dessert we tried the crême brûlée, which was SO decadent with a perfectly crisp glassy top. The key lime pie had a perfect balance of flavor, tartness, sweetness, and a creamy texture complemented well with the crunchy rich crust. I didn't get a chance to try the flourless cake and ice cream but they must have been food because they were gone in a pinch!

Overall great place, I would come back if I was in the area. Lots of options to fit any budget and generally enjoyable experience!",131,492
Mike S.,16/09/23,,,,5,Just amazing. Some of the best food I've had in a long time. Excellent cuts of steak and great service.,142,
John G.,11/10/23,,,,5,"Visited for our 27th Anniversary. First timers. Bring your wallet, but this place is AMAZING and you won't regret. I would go back in a heartbeat. 

I don't think I've ever had a steak this good. We shared the Chateaubriand medium rare with butter on top. It was wonderful. We also got side of red potato's and a few drinks. Service was impeccable. 

Make reservations. The place is small but charming. 

Keep up the great work Black Cow!",347,48
Anne P.,11/10/23,,,,5,This is a phenomenal steakhouse. The cuts of meat are cooked to perfection. Theo drinks are good. Best of all roasted vegetables for a side. Everything was great. Service was also excellent. We will be frequenting this restaurant for sure!,14,
Nancy H.,13/10/23,,,,4,"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and I would say the steak at Black Cow is solid. I thought the steak was seasoned well on its own. Glad to see that they aren't afraid to use salt! We also ordered some sides to share with the table and the lobster mac and cheese was definitely the showstopper. I liked how the mac and cheese had a slight crust on it. The only thing about our experience is that some of our steaks were inconsistent in terms of cook. Some steak frites that were ordered with red came out with no red. The staff apologized and were attentive when we pointed this out and brought out fresh, new steaks cooked to the right temp.",201,33
Braxton C.,13/11/23,,,,5,"Where to start.... first if you are going to go, make a reservation WAY ahead of time. We were lucky to have arrived early and been able to sit at the bar otherwise we would have not been able to eat there.
As for the food, it was spectacular. The steaks are cooked perfectly and all of the flavor of a quality meat you could ask for. They have a variety of choices but I would say you can't go wrong with any of them.
Most importantly, you will enjoy anything you get.",2,1
Amie P.,20/11/23,,,,5,"Great spot, fun vibe, excellent food! The shrimp cocktail, beet salad and lobster mac were delicious. My husband and I split a rib eye which was also amazing.",11,51
Jake B.,26/11/23,,,,5,"Went here for a date night, and let me just say...Best. Restaurant. Ever. It was cold outside and they offered us blankets and hot water. Very generous! Our waitress was named Valerie. Best. Server. Ever. We ordered elk and the black cow burger. Best. Decision. Ever. We also had bread and butter. Now this wasn't your Texas Roadhouse bread and butter...this was bread and butter made from God himself. On the side we got whipped mashed potatoes...like holy cow! Gloriousness. Then to finish it off we got crème brûlée and **** me that was to die for. And let me say all that was inexpensive for the heaven that reached my stomach. At the end we thought this awesome customer service and restaurant was the end, but we were wrong. They packed our food for us?! We tipped well! Let me say again. BEST. RESTAURANT. EVER.",9,
Allison M.,01/12/23,1,,1,5,"Highly recommend taking advantage of their happy hour deal where you can get steak frites (chef's cut of choice and a sauce) for less than $20 (plus drink deals too!). What a steal for a high quality tasty steak and delicious crispy fries. I got to try the flank with chimichurri sauce and it was perfectly cooked, tender, and flavorful. I have nothing bad to say about it! I also tried the fried brussels - one of my favorite sides/appetizers and they did not disappoint. I was particularly happy with the bits of apple and pickled fennel in it. I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time as this place stays busy. There is bar seating available and a comfortable space of both indoor and outdoor tables (with heaters).",400,498
Ferdinand M.,02/12/23,,,,5,I've eaten steaks all over the world and while we were visiting the wineries in this area I could not pass up this place based on their reviews. It's not often you eat a steak Argentine style. The service was great and loved the ambiance. Enjoy!!,13,5
John C.,09/12/23,,,,5,The food here was great. Extremely tasty. Very fresh. Service was amazing. The waiter was super knowledgeable about the entire menu and very attentive. I would highly recommend.,417,100
Rachel S.,17/12/23,,,,5,"The food was so, soooo good. Best I've had in a while. Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive. It's a bit higher-priced than some other places in the area, but it's well worth it for the quality of ingredients, preparation, and overall experience. I can't wait to go back and try different cuts!",4,87
Yvonne Z.,17/12/23,,,,5,"So happy Charlottesville finally has a good steak place! You can definitely tell the steaks are high quality and they were cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend coming during happy hour (4:30-6 pm) for the Chefs Special steak frites which includes 6 oz steak cut, fries, and sauce (could also add salad for $3). I also ordered a side of brussle sprouts and they were amazing - had a perfect char to them and topped with some pickled radish and apple that helped cut into the fat. I'm already looking forward to coming here again!",112,279
Terri W.,24/12/23,,,,5,"Food was freaking awesome and they had cherry coke! The fries that came with our burgers were some of the best I've had (Belgian fries). My only complaint is that the chef cooks burgers ""pink"" or ""some pink"". My fiancee thought it was perfect and melted in his mouth, but I ordered mine ""some pink"" and really struggled. It wasn't the usual ""medium"" pink I order. Besides that, just be aware this restaurant takes reservations only, unless you sit at the bar, but seating there is limited and fills up quickly.",28,
Courtney T.,20/01/24,,,,2,"Maybe it was just a really off night for the food we were served when we visited the Black Cow Chophouse . They have an amazing sounding happy hour where you can order Steak Frites for $18. We decided to stop in after a long week of work and got there around 5:40 (happy hour of 4-6). The hostess told us we had 5 minutes to order so we hurried to the last two seats at the bar and ordered quickly.

I ordered a Moscow Mule and my boyfriend ordered a Margarita. Both were just not good. The Moscow mule had virtually no ginger beer in it.

The steak dinners were so disappointing. Everything was SO salty-I couldn't even eat the fries. The one steak was cooked incorrectly (asked for medium rare and it was medium well). Both steaks were warm at best, definitely not fresh. We understand steaks need to rest but these had rested wayyyy too long. 

The bartender never checked on us. The two stars are for the ambiance of the restaurant. For almost $70, definitely a disappointing visit.",227,8
Holden B.,21/01/24,,,,5,"The Black Cow Chophouse is one of the most amazing places I have ever dined. I have spent six months trying to come up with a way to accurately describe this restaurant in a review. The staff and service is phenomenal, personal, and full of expertise. The selection of local steak is not only artisan but also very well priced, the cocktails are handcrafted with a wonderful attention to detail. The Steak Tare Tare and the crushed potatoes are by far the best food I've ever had, over the several visits to the Black Cow the bar is raised every time by consistent performance. I have had the luxury of eating across several countries and I can say without a doubt the Black Cow Chophouse is one of the finest places I have ever been. If I were given the choice of my last meal on earth it would be at this restaurant. I always look forward to any opportunity to visit.",1,
Rose H.,30/01/24,,,,5,"Let me clear up a misconception about cost. This restaurant fairly priced its selections. The caliber of the food is exceptional. The portions are generous, so much so that salads and sides are easily shared by two without skimping. If you appreciate fine food then you will agree that the prices are appropriate given the size and quality the Black Cow Chophouse offers. Try the Veal...WOW!
Matre'd was exceptional on January 28th as was Meesha our server. This NYC girl enjoyed a fine dinner and celebrated a milestone birthday with Black Cow Chophouse. Thank you to all",42,
H K.,03/02/24,,,,5,Excellent steak and sides in a comfortable atmosphere. On weekends make a reservation or go very early or very late.,46,1
Patricia T.,19/02/24,,,,1,My party of six walked in to have dinner at 7:15pm. After 20 min of wait they told us they couldn't sit us down because they had ran out of food and they had other reservations. This is while someone was already preparing the table for our group. Clearly communication lacks between employees. Next time it will be nice to know from the beginning and not have us wait in the cold (outside) while they figured they didn't have enough food to serve people. While food looks great online the service was horrific.,3,
Kevin K.,14/03/24,,,,3,Good food (typical steakhouse not extraordinary but very solid) and insincere upsell sort of waiter (who was professional otherwise)  but didn't appreciate the woke ban on legal concealed carry prominently featured on the door. Bad policy. I don't patronize places that try to play cop. Plenty of other choices.,110,1
Paul M.,18/03/24,,,,5,"Amazing food, service, and ambiance! Best steak in town. The Black Cow is a must visit in Charlottesville.",8,2
Elizabeth D.,30/03/24,,,,5,"We loved our dinner at Black Cow! We were only in town for two days and didn't have dinner plans our second night, but we had walked past this place earlier in the day and decided to come back that night - so glad we did! It was pretty full, even at 8:45 when we got there, and the vibe was great - simple and modern aesthetic, laid back feel, friendly staff, good wine list - checked all the boxes!

We shared the bone-in KC strip and the whipped golden potatoes for dinner. The steak tasted great - we ordered in medium rare, and it almost looked closer to rare, but I'll take that over a steak being overcooked any day. I liked the confit onions & garlic and the generous pile of sea salt on the plate with the steak, too - really brought out the flavor! The whipped potatoes were a treat as well - they had some of the confit onions and garlic on them too, and they were a great compliment to the meat. 

Would definitely recommend Black Cow to anyone looking for a great steak in Charlottesville - it was lovely!",213,410
Chip H.,04/04/24,,,,5,"A wonderful dinner at Black Cow last night, great beef and a lengthy wine list. Our server, Landon, was fast and knowledgeable and also a class act: I paid for the six of us and added tip then, as we were standing out front, Landon came running out to let me know the tip had already been included. I added a bit more but even so, he saved me a considerable sum. Thank you, Landon, and we highly recommend Black Cow!",25,86
Matt B.,12/04/24,,,,5,"Great steak, great sides, and good vibes. The service is great and attentive. It's definitely one of my favorite, if not top steak house in Cville.",19,2
Dany B.,16/04/24,,,,3,"Pretty solid food and service. But they have not cooked my steak correct a single time I have gone. The first two times I asked for medium, the steak came out completely raw (they cut it before service, so they are aware of the steak's temperature). 

Last time I went, I was asked if I wanted my steak ""pink or no pink"" which is very strange and probably not what you should be asking for a steak. The steak came out cold and raw on the inside. Given the language on the menu, the kitchen seems to have strong opinions on how a steak needs to be cooked (raw/rare). To sum up, if you want solid food and are cool with your steak being very undercooked, I think you will enjoy this place a lot.",18,1
Allen T.,27/04/24,,,,5,"Happy hour review only!

Came here for the Happy and we ordered the Steak Frites, Mac & Cheese, Lobster Bisque and the Brussel Sprouts. Wow the Steak Frites is Huge value as is it he lobster mac and cheese. I would definitely come back for the HAPPY HOUR. Very Very Good restaurant with great service right on the main street across from the Quirk hotel.",393,312

LeAnn M.,30/04/24,,1,,3,"Disappointed overall. Urban-like atmosphere--comfortable. Meal service excellent--Dinner salad unmemorable, asparagus wilted, crispy potatoes good.  Steak well done-ordered medium. Cut off several burned pieces. Took overly long time for bar service. For a $220+ meal for 2-disappointing.",6,
Kaitlin R.,01/05/24,,,,5,Excellent service and great value at this location - would come back again and again. If only we lived closer! We sat outside protected from the rain and had a delicious meal and yummy cocktails.,15,315
William Y.,04/05/24,,,,5,"Drove into Charlottesville, VA from Baltimore, and went to the Yelp app to look for a dinner venue.  The Black Cow looked interesting, and we were ready for red meat.

The venue is cool.  It appears to be an old service station that has been  decorated in a bovid motief.  It has a nice bar, not very large, seats about 10.  Outside dining is available

We did not have reservations, and the wait was about an hour, so we chose to eat at the bar.  Good choice!  The bartender (Noah) was excellent.  The bourbon selection was also excellent.  I had my first pour of Woodford 121.2.  Really enjoyed it.

The salads were good.  Warm bread was served.  We both had the New York strip, and they were nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked.

Ratings:
Venue 4/5. Found the barrel bar stools uncomfortable.
Service - 5/5
Food - 5/5
Cost - $$$
Overall, we had a very good experience.",127,48
Blake C.,06/05/24,,,,2,"Service was good and quick, large portions. Honestly, portions were too large. No way a group of 2 could finish even one side dish. Food was underseadoned for my taste. Everything we ordered (except for the complimentary bread and butter) needed salt at the least. Crab cakes were bland and oddly sweet. Lobster mac and cheese sauce was a little grainy, maybe too much flour used. It also had little to no seasoning. Was disappointed given the cost. I hate to say this, but Oakhart Social, which is across the street, has much better flavors at a more reasonable cost.",1,
Johnson D.,13/05/24,,,,5,"The appetizer Steak and fries, the steak is perfectly cooked tenderloin. We had the salmon and crab cakes, house salads and oyster Rockefeller! Our waitress was awesome and food was delicious! Definitely will be back!",20,12

Mily L.,01/06/24,,,,5,"Went here for Happy Hour while I was in Charlottesville for a work trip. My two daughters and I sat at the bar, as we didn't have reservations. Our experience was excellent. The bartenders (especially the female one) were so warm, professional, and accommodating. I had the best cosmopolitan drink of my life. We decided to order one additional steak a few minutes before the happy hour promotion expired, and the bartender quietly told the kitchen to rush the order so that it would come out with the rest of our food, just a couple of minutes later. The happy hour steak frites special is a must-order, and an incredible value. Highly recommend if you're in Charlottesville and staying near the downtown area. One thing to note: downtown Charlottesville does have a significant homeless and panhandling population. We were approached at our car in the adjacent parking lot. However, the neighborhood was clean and the restaurant itself had great ambiance.",104,7
Michael C.,08/06/24,,,,5,"My wife and I had the pleasure of having our 30th anniversary dinner here. It was just the two of us and what an amazing experience. Our server's name was Julie (Thulee, rulie) and was by far one of the nicest people that we
Have ever had as a server: our water
Was never empty, our drinks were fast and her
Knowledge of the menu and taste was impeccable.  Happy hour was amazing! We had the $8.00 Kentucky mule and margaritas. Strong! 
Our Dinner was the steak frites and was the best steak I have ever had in my entire life! ( the cut was something that began with a T). The sauce that came with it was a house made A-1 sauce that was really good and blue cheese crumbles.Fries were good, but nothing over the top. Our side was the summer squash! What the hell...! To make that vegetable stand out like it did, I was speechless.  Roasted and placed in a cashew pesto!! We were fighting with forks for the last bite!
One more drink each. Oh our hostess came over and wished us a happy anniversary, and made my wife tear up when she read to my wife what I wrote about her. Very nice young lady and I am so sorry that I forgot her name. 
 The dessert....holy moly....!
The chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce was a knockout! I would bar fight the whole
Place for more. The crème Brule, was also outstanding an came in a close
Second for dessert.
I must say we have missed out on this little
Gem, and is m pleased to have found it! We
Will be back and will try the key lime pie and the lemon-chelo tiramisu with raspberries! 
Thank-you all so much!!
Made my weekend!",30,2
B R.,15/06/24,,,,5,"Short and to the point.   Service is excellent here and the meat is worth every penny.  I met a friend for dinner on a Wednesday.  Had the tenderloin and brussel sprouts.  Both were fantastic.  The tenderloin may have been the best cut of meat I've ever had.  Truly excellent.  Better than any top shelf NYC steakhouse or Kansas City steakhouse.  I've been to many of both and this was better.  If you like steak, this is your place.  Expensive, yes.  But worth it.",82,1
Tony P.,16/06/24,,,,5,"Toni the host was amazing and seated me quickly as possible with kind and politeness. Noah and Jules were extremely quick at the bar, provided amazing hospitality to trying several variety of wine to my liking. They were very nice and attentive, always checking up and making sure everyone was good. I got the bavatte, a recommendation from Noah which was an amazing choice for 1 person. I had mine cooked medium rare. The steak came out tender like if it was a filet mignon but tasty like if it was a ribeye cut. This was the first time I came here and definitely won't be the last !!",19,15
Michael M.,21/06/24,,,,5,"Had a great dinner here, buy some freak our reservation was for Black cow in Massachusetts not here in Charlottesville.  Staff was super helpful and found us a table. John, our waiter, absolutely first rate.   Great happy hour specials, awesome steaks, everything done just right. Highly recommend five star kind of place.   Casual, no need to wear a jacket and tie, but food is top-notch",73,
Eric T.,22/06/24,,,,3,The ribeye steak was excellent along with the lobster Mac n cheese. The staff was friendly. The atmosphere is lively. Probably a little overpriced for a casual restaurant.,22,
Jim L.,22/06/24,,,,5,This place is pretty amazing. It's a bit pricey but they cook the steak perfect! The appetisers are pretty good! I would definitely come back again,250,250
Ross G.,13/07/24,,,,5,"Add us to the Black Cow fan club!  We split our time between Cville and Austin now, and it seems each time we return another steakhouse has closed.  It was great to see a new steakhouse--and a good one!-- has finally opened.  A friend invited us for a very early dinner so we could try the ""early bird"" Steak and Frites meal.  At $18, it seemed too good to be true.  It isn't!  It appears they vary the steak cut and the sauce each week.  This time it was 6 oz sirloin with meunière sauce and fries.  For $3 you can add a dinner salad, which I did.  The steak was prepared perfectly: rare for me and well done for my wife (they say there are only two choices, pink and well, but I asked for the rarest they would cook my steak and was very happy).  We both passed on the sauce, which the flavorful, juicy steak didn't need.  My salad was just fine.  The highlight of the meal--good as the steak was--is the fries.  A nice portion of perfectly fried, hot, relatively thin French fries.

Our waiter was friendly, patient, and helpful.  The entire experience was excellent and we will return, and not just for the special.  The regular steak menu looked wonderful.  While not cheap, for a high-end steakhouse prices seemed quite reasonable.",36,9

Our server was so knowledgeable and nice! By coincidence, we came in during happy hour and it's a really great one.  The margaritas were delicious and the food was great.  Would love to come back again!",151,2
Christine B.,21/07/24,,,,4,We went here for dinner while on a mini-honeymoon. I noted it in the reservation but they didn't acknowledge it in way which was a little disappointing. The food was really good though. We shared a hangar steak and a filet. Both were cooked to medium rare. I thought the hangar steak had a really good flavor. You could actually taste the marinade. My husband loved the bernaise sauce with the filet. For sides we had spinach and the Belgian fries. The spinach is definitely pretty spinachy if that makes sense. Not your typical creamed spinach. It was good. The fries were very small and crispy and not like anything we had in Belgian. The flavor was good but I would skip them next time. I already recommended this spot to other people around town looking for a steak and I would go back.,945,125
Ron C.,21/07/24,,,,1,So look guy's  i have never sent food back.....but when i get it and its over cooked the they bring it back rarer than when i sent it in...... there's some shenanigans going on...   and the bad part is it was my first drink of the night.....,31,

I brought my daughter for a late lunch, without knowing you need a reservation but they made sure to get us a table. It's not cheap but you definitely get what you pay for. You won't be disappointed. Steaks are large and you will need a to go box",7,116
Rachel C.,29/09/24,,,,5,"Everything was great at Black Cow Chophouse - the service, ambiance, food. We got a reservation for 8:15 and showed up at 6:30 hoping for a seat at the bar. We were well taken care of by the hostess and bartender who got us to the bar around 7:30 after we opened a bottle of wine on their outdoor lounge. 

The bar was cozy and the servers were attentive and warm, but the food was exactly what I needed that day! They cook their burgers ""no pink"" or ""pink"" and I assume ""no pink"" is closer to medium and ""pink"" is medium rare to rare. We ordered a bacon bleu burger ""pink"" and were really happy with it. Typically I like my burgers medium so I might try taking my chances with the no pink next time since I can't see them cooking it over with their ""no well done"" policy for the cuts of meat. 

The fries, Brussels sprouts, and Mac and cheese were delicious, especially with the garlic aioli. I think after the burger, the Mac and cheese was a favorite. I don't usually go for lobster Mac and cheese, but this one was exceptional. You could actually taste the lobster stock throughout the sauce as well as the cheese.",72,301
Sharee P.,06/10/24,,,,5,This was soo good. I went here for my birthday and was treated like a queen. My ribeye was cooked to perfection. You should definitely add this spot to your trip to the area .,5,
J G.,09/10/24,,,,3,"Service was great!  Steak is really good.  My wife wanted to add bacon to her salad and she does that at every restaurant we go to.  When we asked about doing that they simply said they don't allow that. I asked do you have bacon and they replied yes then I asked why they wouldn't and they said because the chef wouldn't allow
It. I'm not sure why the chef wouldn't allow this he wasn't paying the bill. After that happened it threw us off. Not sure we will make the drive again!",60,
Kevin K.,12/10/24,,,,5,"We were in town for a few days and were able to grab spots at the bar.  Service at the bar was excellent and we were constantly checked on. 

The happy hour steak frites hit the spot and the dry aged ribeyes were incredible (but they sell out early) and were perfectly cooked.  Definitely recommend the brussel sprouts and red potatoes smashers as sides.  The key lime pie ended the evening perfectly.   

Definitely get a reservation if you want to eat here as it fills up quickly, starting about 5:15 and the bar o lot has about 8 seat.  Highly recommended if you are in town and want a great meal.",3,
Rhonda J.,14/10/24,,,,3,"This was the first time we ever ate at Black Cow Chophouse. We frequent steakhouses often and looked forward to trying a new one. Made reservations in advance and was seated promptly. 

We placed our orders (party of four) and two of use do not eat salads. After some time passed we were given 2 salads and one portion of bread for 4 people. Almost one hour passed and we still didn't have our entrees. I asked for another bread and she said it would cost $3. I said it was ok and she came back and told us they will not be doing double breads. 

About 15 mins later the meals came out and my medium well steak was clearly undercooked. It was pink and a little bloody. The waitress told me that it was medium well in front of my party. I disagreed and she then agreed to recook it. Another person in my party ordered a medium steak and it was also bloody. She didn't want to say anything after seeing the reaction I got. They brought my steak back to me and half of it was cooked and the other half looked the same. She walked away before I could say anything. I actually picked up the plate, located her and told her I give up. The manager came over and told me she wanted to talk about the steak. Again, this felt weird in front of my party and I'm on the spot. I said half of it was improved but it's too bloody on the other. I just wanted to move on. 

Overall, my party was happy with the food. A little disappointed the reaction and combativeness about the steak temperature. So I didn't get a steak and still wasn't offered some bread while everyone else ate their meals",87,
Marie F.,20/10/24,,,,5,"We sat outside and had dinner after a day at Carter Mountain/ winery hopping. It was phenomenal and delicious. The server was super helpful, starting with offering a taste of the wine before pouring a full glass. The steak tartare app was amazing and our meals were incredible. Highly recommend!",24,85
Danielle M.,16/12/24,,,,5,"John our waiter took such lovely care of us. He was right. This steak (I got the boneless ribeye) was one of the top 10 steaks I've ever had in my life. You can tell the meat here is very high quality. The steak came out with a lovely sear. The flavor was rich and meaty; my steak was very well marbled and fatty. I loved that the steaks were served with flaked finishing salt that you could sprinkle on, yourself. I believe the biggest factor was that David cooked our steaks to PERFECTION. My husband got the NY Strip and he was over the moon. I tried a bite and it was just fantastic. I'm not even a NY strip eater! You can easily mess up a Strip. And yet it was juicy and tender.

I personally don't think the steak needed a sauce.

As for the appetizers and sides, the bread was excellent and fresh. The cesar salad was very very tasty. The shrimp cocktail was great! But the real show were those steaks. John, our waiter, encouraged us as first time guests to get steak (over the pork chop I was considering), and I'm so thrilled he did. A warm and genuinely friendly waiter, John made the night. I trusted his suggestions, and very happy I did. You can tell John loves his job, and he's good at it.

The prices were fair given the quality of the ingredients.

The ambiance of the restaurant was somewhat loud but that never hindered our conversations or evening.

The final suprise of the night was the desserts. The key lime pie was literally the best key lime pie I've ever had. Was such a perfect touch to a wonderful evening.

Kudos to this team. A giant thank you to John for taking such great care of us, and the highest compliments to David and the chefs who prepared the meals.

Curtis T.,20/12/24,,,,1,"We made a dinner reservation to celebrate a very good year for our business. While the drinks were food and drinks were excellent, we were hustled multiple times during the meal, before we even ordered; we were told several times that our table needed to be done by a specific time (2 hours). we were told at least 3 times that we needed to be faster, when we finished our main and inquired about desert we were told that the next table was here and that we could only have dessert to go. when the check arrived we set it for pay immediately, but they took 10 min to collect it, which felt strange considering that they had been adamant that they needed the table.
not sure if this is their policy or they poorly planed their reservations
Great food does not make up for poor treatment by staff, and 2 hours at a steak house is not a long time for a group of 4.
Several of us have worked in the industry and remarked that there are times that reservations stay longer than anticipated, and you figure it out.
All in all, great food; poor treatment by staff, I know that we will not be back or be recommending them.",3,160
EmmaLeigh H.,25/12/24,,,,4,"We've been here a few times and the steaks are always cooked perfectly and the Caesar salad has an amazing anchovy dressing that doesn't overpower and drench the salad. The Lobster mac and cheese is delicious and I'm not even a mac and cheese kinda gal. Happy hour is a good way to save some $ but I'm not sure if it's worth it at the end of the day because it's a lower quality cut, and our steak was extremely chewy despite it being cooked medium rare.  However, the lower price steak frites happy hour allows you to explore other menu options like that lobster mac and cheese!",18,
Erin H.,27/12/24,,,,5,"Been trying to try this spot for awhile based on a friends review.  Took friends out for a birthday dinner - they let them have a complimentary glass of cava to start which was nice.  The vibe is fun and a good renovation of the old gas station (although the bathrooms need some design help).  But enough about that let's talk food.  They have a fabulous happy hour special and one of enjoyed that (cut of the day, sauce of the day, and fries).  I enjoyed the hanger since I like a medium rare steak and the special only comes pink or no pink.  We ordered fries - super crispy!  Double fried I was informed.  Should've gone with the Brussels sprouts instead of the creamed spinach it was watery and under seasoned.  I would definitely go again.  Pro tip there was a line when we showed up for our 4:30 reservation - bar seating is first come first serve so people line up early to get a great meal at an amazing price.",60,109

Kristy W.,17/01/25,,,,5,"Each and every time we come it is spectacular. This is our go to place if we're looking for a great meal, a date night spot, a good drink, and/or a place to take out of town guests. We even celebrated closing on our house here and it was the first restaurant we visited when we first came to town. Everything is top notch, from the atmosphere, to the cuts of meat, to the sides, and happy hour. Happy hour is the BEST deal in town. A smaller portion of steak (sometimes a great cut of filet) with a sauce of the day and fries for $18, add a salad to that and it's $21. Cocktails from a limited menu are $8. Can't beat it. Some of our other favorites are the hanger steak, filet, Brussel sprouts, and red smash potatoes. The servers are exceptional, attentive, and go above and beyond to get to know you.",70,272
