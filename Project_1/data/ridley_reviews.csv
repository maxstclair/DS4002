1,,Alyssa M.,10/04/21,,,1,5,"This restaurant was such a great find during our stay outside of Charlottesville! Amazing food, super courteous staff and a great atmosphere. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area. Our table split some of the tomahawk steak and it was cooked perfectly!! Would suggest the mac n' cheese and any of their apps as well. The owners were so kind and down to earth. Love this place!",28,,view review
2,,Olivia B.,12/04/21,,,1,4,"I enjoyed an excellent brunch a few Sundays ago and will return. The selection is bountiful with basic breakfast choices to entrees. They offer signature cocktails to accompany the deliciousness The Ridley Bruch has in store for you!! I highly recommend the Jalapeno Cornbread, French Toast, and a Mimosa for starters!",2,7,view review
3,,Nour O.,14/05/21,1,1,3,5,"What an unexpected great meal at The Ridley! Although, the star of the show (unfortunately not pictured): the wings! I did not have any expectations so I was amazed. It has the absolute perfect crispy outer crust. The wings were so tender and delicious. We were in the mood for brunch. The french toast was the fluffiest and thickest I've seen. It has an interesting flavor because it is cereal crusted but I really enjoyed it! The strawberries were a great compliment. It was a really big meal which is enough for 2 people. If you eat slow it might get a little soggy and cold which is less enjoyable. The crab cake Benedict was also a great and filling meal. It wasn't as crabby as I thought it would be. But that was a perfect balance. The Ridley is located under a hotel, and so the atmosphere is an upper-end establishment.",33,129,view review
4,,Erin R.,30/05/21,,,1,4,"Review for drinks only:
Enjoyed sitting at their light and airy bar (even on a cloudy, rainy day!) to watch some sports and enjoy a few drinks. For how expensive the food menu looks, I was happy to find a $8 pinot noir, which was very easy drinking.   It was an enjoyable place to waste a few hours.",1001,313,view review
5,,Philicia R.,14/06/21,,,,4,"Recently visited the Ridley. The service was great! She was knowledgeable about the menu and could give recommendations. 

For starters, we ordered Brussel sprouts, deviled eggs, snapper bites, and jalapeño cornbread. Everything comes out in a small cast iron skillet except the fish bites. The fish bites include fried carrots and zucchini. Would definitely recommend. The cornbread is amazing! The texture melts in your mouth. Similar to a cake. The Brussel sprouts are topped with bacon and shaved almonds.

If going for dinner right at 5, give yourself enough time to find parking. The parking there is $5. We were late for our reservation, but when I called they were very understanding. We parked on the street.

The shrimp and grits were great! They were cooked just right. The shrimp were very large! It's a large portion. I originally asked for Bleu cheese when I ordered a salad. The salad came with ranch. The waitress quickly remedied this and bought a different dish. If you're in the area and looking for southern cuisine, I recommend trying.",16,164,view review
6,,AC O.,22/06/21,,,1,5,"This restaurant was amazing! We had fantastic service, everyone was very nice and accommodating. Our food was very very good. One of the best meals we have had in a long time. My husband had the Tomahawk steak and brussel sprouts. I tasted it and it was delicious. The steak melted in your mouth. I had the scallops with the crisp spicy grit cake and chow chow. I will dream about that meal it was that good. We did have reservations and at first it wasn't busy but it dis get more crowded when our dinner was almost over. I would def go here again. Highly recommend!",14,100,view review
7,,Roy T.,25/06/21,,,3,5,"The Ridley was our first dining indoors experience since the Pandemic started. It was my wife's birthday and the food was AMAZING. 

The atmosphere was truly top notch and the staff were quite accommodating. 

I had the roasted chicken, Tammy had the Shrimp and Grits with andouille sausage and we shared apps. 

We weren't drinking, but if I find myself in Charlottesville again, I'm gonna try their signature old fashioned with VA Bourbon. 

The deviled eggs had enough mustard to cut through the extra creamy blend with a shard of bacon on each that elevated them beyond normal. The jalapeño cornbread was a sublime mix of sweet and heat. 

The chicken was perfectly cooked and the carrots roasted to a turn. They were just starting to soften on the outside while still crispy in the center.  I truly enjoyed the roasted pearl
onions which popped in your mouth like flavor bombs. The mashed potatoes where divinely blended.  The grace notes with the rosemary spear and the seasoned salt surrounding the dish so you could spice to preference, individually, on each bite were brilliant. 

After dinner we each had a cup of coffee that ended the evening perfectly. 

Definitely will be returning our next time through Charlottesville.",13,53,view review
8,,Carolyn O.,21/08/21,,,1,2,"New owners really need to step up.  Disappointed in Saturday brunch.  Menu incorrect on at least one item.  Slow service.  Below average food:

French toast not as menu states at all.
Gumbo shrimp still had shells on them.
Bloody Mary tasted of Old Bay and nothing else.",28,71,view review
9,,Ryan K.,07/09/21,1,,2,4,"Decent food. We sat at booth and had dinner at the Ridley on a Saturday night. The Ridley has TVs everywhere giving it the feel of an upscale sports bar. I tried the fried brussels sprouts (without the nuts), the scallops, and the cauliflower steak. The brussels sprouts were excellent and could not have been prepared much better. The scallops were tasty and seemed fresh but were very overcooked (the chef may have been distracted while cooking them). The cauliflower steak itself was tough, but not unappetizing. The fixings for the cauliflower steak were delicious however. Overall, the Ridley was pretty hit-or-miss for me as a dining experience. i don't think the Ridley is a bad restaurant, but there are certainly better options in Charlottesville.",674,21,view review
10,,J E.,02/11/21,4,,5,3,"While staying in C'ville I came here one evening for an appetizer and a couple of drinks. I sat at the bar and was immediately given menus, though I wasn't greeted. The bartender seemed to be pre-occupied much of the time, but was attentive once I got his attention.
They have an interesting menu and also offer cocktails ad wine. The food I saw others get was really nice looking and my brussel sprouts were excellent! The cocktail he made me was really good too.
Prices are ok, a little on the high side. I did like the vibe here, seems like a great place to hang with friends or come for a date.
I'd return.",2898,94,view review
11,,Hector B.,09/11/21,,,1,5,"Another wonderful dinner experience. The service was wonderful from the start to the finish.   The food was very good. We started with deviled eggs which were awesome. My nephew had Burger and fries and just loved it. I enjoyed the shrimp and grits which were different than normal, but were very good.  It seemed to hint more towards the Cajun side than the Southern.. The sauce was dark and little more spicy. Great drinks and decent beer options. Some nice Southern style dessert options. We had the brownies which were wonderful.  Overall it was a very tasty experience with great service and great environments. I will return.",1376,212,view review
12,,Caitlin C.,12/12/21,,,1,5,"Such a gem! 

We had a brunch reservation, but were happily seated early! Wonderful atmosphere, live piano music and outstanding service! The chef checked on every patron to ensure they were pleased with their meal, and the waitstaff was so attentive and friendly! 

The quality of food blew me away and the price point was incredibly reasonable!",8,30,view review
13,,Eva Maria T.,28/12/21,1,,1,4,"We stayed at The Draftsman hotel which is attached to The Ridley. We had breakfast each morning we were there and dinner on Christmas Eve. Food and service were quite good. Staff were very friendly, professional and welcoming. All ingredients were fresh and presentation was visually appealing. Loved the small touch of  real whipped butter at breakfast. Makes spreading on toast much wasie All in all a good experience.",153,72,view review
14,,Krista R.,05/02/22,1,,2,4,"Came here for restaurant week and hadn't been here before but heard some things from fellow UVA coworkers. I tried the Brussels, salmon, and brownie. My friend had the devil egg, steak and cinnamon raisin bread pudding. Everything was really good. But the Brussels and salmon could do without the hot peppers. It didn't had any flavor and just didn't go right with the dish. The Brussels with nice and crispy just perfectly cooked. The salmon with corn was AMAZING. I have a weird obsession with corn  so I was excited to have it come on the dish. The flavors were a perfect mix but again the peppers didn't had any flavor but just spicy that didn't mix well with the dish. The brownie and ice was sooooooo good. I tried my friends steak with chimichurri which also was perfectly cook and the garlic mash was a nice flavorful touch. Her dessert the cinnamon bread pudding was also yummy. Would recommend this place but they need to maybe lay off the peppers in the dishes it just didn't mixed well.",247,352,view review
15,,Maria R.,28/03/22,1,,,5,First time visiting Charlotte and they did not disappoint! Hubby and I were seated right away. Restaurant was clean and not crowded or noisy. Food was prepared quickly and it was downright addictive! I would drive all the way back just for the jalapeños cornbread!,60,2,view review
16,,Valerie G.,28/03/22,1,,2,5,"This restaurant is in an amazing area and has some really good history with all the restaurant got started. Parking was a pain. There's a parking garage directly behind the restaurant, but it's only for the hospital and we wouldn't have known that because the machine let us grab a ticket, but there was a guy that asked if we had an appointment lol. Then there's also a sign that says ""restaurant parking"" right up the street, butttt there is no parking lol it's all permit parking. So we found parking called (I think) ""14 street garage"", it was a 3-5 mins walk, not horrible at all. We weren't here for Sunday brunch, and didn't need a reservation. But it may be best to make one online if you have a big party. The staff was so friendly and they were all wearing mask. It was very clean and the decor was on point. The price point of the food is steep, so plan on spending money. It's very worth it though. We got deviled eggs, which I think was around eight dollars. Shrimp and grits which was $28! And French toast which was $16. We both had alcoholic drinks and ended up spending $86 (before tip) for two of us. But the food is so worth it. The flavors are amazing!! If you're a Natty Bo fan, they serve it here. I was very excited haha",489,219,view review
17,,Sierra G.,07/04/22,,,1,5,"After staying at the Draftsman, my friends and I travelled downstairs to restaurant connected to the lobby, The Ridley. It's safe to say that we're glad that we did. Their lemon drop martini's are to die for and paired perfectly with my steak caesar salad. My friend also thoroughly enjoyed the turkey club. Great ambiance and staff. Definitely will be returning when visiting again!",11,2,view review
18,,Andy N.,16/04/22,,,2,5,"The Ridley was always on my list to try. And it did not disappoint. While a bit pricy, you get everything that you pay for. The flavors are explosive in every aspect. Presentation was phenomenal. And this is an incredible place to treat yourself every once-in-a-while. I can not rave about this place enough. It was absolutely delicious, and I look forward to coming back and trying their other items.",229,88,view review
19,,Leslie V.,24/05/22,,1,2,1,"The bar is attached to the Draftsman Hotel - The Ridley? I would NOT recommend. 
1. We sat at a high top and the guy (I refuse to call him a bartender) looked at us. I said, Do you need us to come up and order? He shook his head Yes. 
2. My husband walked up to order and I said our table needs a wipedown. He gave a dry rag to my husband to give to me. 
3. Then my husband asked about a dark beer for me and he handed him a bottle of the only one they had. (I guess so we could decide??) I said yes, that'll be great and we ordered. My husband came over to sit down and the guy called him over to come and get his drink. (There are 4 other people in this entire bar) My hubby said, ""This is pretty hard on your tip.""He just stared at him. 
4. We are excited about returning the kindnesses by showing him how it actually affects his tip. (We are only having one drink, obviously!) 

I texted my daughter, who lives here and works at the UVA Cancer Center. This was her reply:

I've been there once and had the EXACT same experience. I went with like 4 or 5 colleagues after work and we all said we would never go there again. And we all spread the news about the Ridley. Pretty dumb of them because they're right next to the hospital so it would be a great spot but their service is awful and down right rude.

Enough said.",356,164,view review
20,,Olivia W.,15/06/22,1,,1,5,"Went for breakfast after spending the night at the Draftsman, and no complaints. Coffee was fresh, the breakfast plates were huge, and service was friendly. Couldn't ask for anything else to start our day :)",594,142,view review
21,,Buck B.,08/07/22,,,,1,"Update. The name has changed, but the game is the same.
I reviewed three years ago as ""Renewal,"" and now as ""The Ridley.""

I realize that there has been a pandemic and that hiring/staffing/training are extremely challenging.

But once again, if you're charging $100 for a meal, the standards are higher than that of Chili's, which by the way, is a far superior option. (Jokes aside, your money is better spent at C and O, Bizou, Crush pad, Ivy Inn, Tavola, Local, Tavern and Grocery, Bebedero, etc. etc.)

Opening moment. I'm standing with my party of 15 are the host stand.  A server (not eventually our server) informed me: ""Get out of the way!""  No please, no apology, no grace.  By the way, the restaurant was completely empty at this point, and all other ""nice"" Charlottesville restaurants were entirely booked. I should have clued in at this point...

The wine, beer and cocktails: Great, no complaints. 

The food.  Two plates of RAW oysters came out that were *hot* to the touch. I've never seen this in all my years...

I ordered steak frites (medium).  The steak was bland, over-cooked and tasteless. The fries were mushy as if in a soup.  I didn't know this dish could be so mishandled. 

My dinner mates had similar experiences with their entrees, and we tried to smile and enjoy the evening nonetheless. 

The decor and the outdoor seating are still fantastic.",74,5,view review
22,,Chris S.,13/07/22,,,,2,"This review is heavily influenced by the price they charge for the food you're served. If this was an inexpensive restaurant, then the service and quality would be passable. However, nearly $100 for two people for dinner and the food was pretty sub-par. There's so many restaurants in the area with better food at a fraction of the price and significantly better service that it's hard to justify coming here. Beautiful restaurant that unfortunately doesn't have the quality or service to match.

If you're staying at the attached hotel, take a walk a couple blocks in any direction and have a much better meal at a far lower price.",20,2,view review
23,,Jeff W.,24/08/22,1,,,5,"Great atmosphere, fantastic service  Chicken and biscuits, eggs Benedict, avocado toast, pork sausage, and Mac and cheese are all great options. Nice and close to the UVA grounds. Our go to place if we're not sure where to eat.",172,149,view review
24,,Leslie S.,25/08/22,,,1,5,"I took my husband out to dinner for his birthday.  We had such a great time.  The atmosphere was lovely.  Our server, Morgan, was top notch and did not skip a beat when it came to making sure that we were happy with our dining experience.  And our bartender, TJ, was so professional and knowledgeable about our choice in Tequila for shots.  My husband was very pleased.  The food was delicious and the portions were big.  There was no disappointment at all in our visit to the Ridley.  My husband says that he wants to visit again soon. I agree!   Bon Appetit!",1,140,view review

26,,Jessi S.,25/09/22,,,2,4,"The Ridley is always taking good care of their healthcare workers! On Mondays, they have drink specials with ID and just recently I received a 50% off coupon to use. I have been here for late night drinks before, it's a really nice vibe to sit out on the patio and people watch the college kids walk by. I tried their chicken biscuit on brunch and it was delicious! The chicken was fried perfectly, the salty sauce was yummy, and their biscuit was huge and didn't crumble under the pressure. The poached egg, unfortunately, was cooked hard, so it didn't spill over my dish as I liked. This dish is about $20, so it is definitely on the pricier side- I probably would never have gone to eat here if I didn't have the discount!",437,386,view review

29,,Melinda B.,17/10/22,,,,2,"I stopped by for mimosas a few weeks ago with my husband and friends, the experience was great.
Today was a completely different story altogether.  I am staying here overnight and went down to the restaurant for a quick salad and a glass of wine.  I waited at the hostess stand for several minutes and a young lady who was a server came up to the stand and asked me what I'd like to order, which was very odd.  I asked her if I could be seated and she took me to a table.  I then told her that I was ready so I ordered a glass of wine and a wedge salad then asked for a glass of water because I'm very thirsty. Then, I waited....another woman came out to bring me my salad, which was delicious.  I told her that I had not gotten my water or glass of wine.  She apologized and said that my wine would be comped, which was very thoughtful.  I ate my salad and waited for 10 minutes to ask for my check, the server never came out of the kitchen.  I asked another server if he would tell my server that I went out to the bar area with my wine and I'd like my check.  I finished my glass of wine and still no server.  I finally found her and asked her for my check.  I did let her know that I was not satisfied with the service and she apologized.
My take, don't come to eat at 2:15pm because you will be ignored.  Sad, this is a beautiful hotel but I doubt that I'd ever eat here again. 
I gave 2 stars based on my last visit to the bar and that my salad was good.",93,54,view review
30,,Christine F.,20/10/22,,1,1,1,"My husband and I were excited about trying out this restaurant. It's really nice inside so I had high hopes.
I have food sensitivities so when I asked if my pork chop could be cooked with olive oil, the server had to go to the kitchen and  ask. She came back and said their olive oil was 90% soybean oil. I cannot tolerate soy. I asked her again to check to see if there was any real olive oil in the restaurant. She checked again and said no. Apparently, they only use cheap vegetable oils, which are inflammatory to me.
I understand many restaurants use cheap oil, but I've never been to a restaurant this nice that had ZERO real olive oil. Every time we eat out at a nice place, I always ask for olive oil. I've never had a problem. I'm not sure what the Ridley is doing but they should try cooking with quality oils that make food taste better. My husband and I walked out.",17,161,view review
31,,Jessica M.,22/10/22,1,,1,5,"The Ridley will always have a special place in our hearts and our stomachs we've been coming here for a couple of years now and they honestly never disappoint. The menu has changed a bit over time and as much as i miss some of the old dishes, the new items are just as delicious. I highly recommend the crab cakes. Almost all crab lump meat, very little filler, and seasoned to perfection. And if you have room for dessert, the bread pudding is out of this world!",62,9,view review
32,,Samantha J.,22/10/22,,,,1,"Had a reservation on a Friday night. 20 minutes after sitting down nobody had come by to even offer waters. It was moderately busy, but still a few empty tables. Walked out due to poor service.",8,1,view review
33,,Tom M.,22/10/22,,1,,2,"Was not a very desirable dining experience.  First off, we pulled into the Valet parking, and they told us that parking was for hotel guests only, and that we would have to find a parking garage which was a couple blocks away.  That's crap.  He did show us a lot across the way which was sketchy at best.

Next we checked in with the hostess and as we were walking to our table she asked if we wouldn't mind sharing a menu.  Really.....out of menu's.  She seated us at a small table and we asked if we could have the table near the window so we can keep an eye on the lot where our car was parked.  The floor manager came by and said that that table was reserved and people had reservations and were waiting.  I said, we had reservations too, and she (Kim is her name) rudely insisted that we take our table because the other table was reserved.  At that point we almost walked out...We opted to at least try the cuisine.

After a few minutes, the server finally came, by that time we had all our choices made.  I ordered the Ribeye and my wife ordered the Crab Cakes. (all different than online menu)  My wife orders a white wine with her entrée and I ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon with mine.  She got her White and I also received a white.  As she was scurrying away I called her back and told her I ordered a red.  She said let me check to see what you ordered.  Really....I know what I ordered and a cab is a red.  She came back and said the Bartender made the mistake. 

The food did come a little over 10 minutes from order (we had a timer going) which was impressive.  My wife said the crab cakes were pretty good and my ribeye was good, not great and a restaurant of this caliber ought to be.  The steak was on top the mashed potatoes and asparagus and when I went to cut the steak and the mashed potatoes oozed out from under the steak and all the steak juice was in the potatoes which I would rather pool on the place to swab my bites in. 

In summary, sounds like the restaurant is for guests only, based on no parking for outsiders.  Kim the floor manager is rude and there were not enough menu's.  Food was good, not great, which a restaurant of this caliber should present.

By the way, at the time we were leaving, nobody was ever seated at the table by the window we requested.  They merged it with another table which STILL, nobody was sitting at when we left.  So Kim lied to us!  No reservations for a small table.

We will never return!",155,,view review
34,,Angie D.,27/10/22,1,,,3,"1st time dining there. Service was great (thanks, Brandon). Drinks were strong (another plus) considering they're a little pricey. Brussel sprouts were very tasty! My Nashville Hot chicken sandwich had all the flavor and crispiness I wanted but the chicken itself was tough and rubbery. Hard to eat. Mashed potatoes were lacking flavor and texture seemed like they maybe sat out too long or under a hot lamp? Even so,  I definitely want to try a meal there again as the atmosphere is gorgeous.",5,,view review

The service was amazing! I wish I remembered my servers name because she was really sweet.
Lastly the food CHILE...so flavorful. I'm not vegetarian but I don't regret ordering the fried green tomatoes as my entree. I also tried the shrimp po boy and oysters Rockefeller, both tasty dishes.
I had 2 drinks, the pomegranate blossom and the Dr. Ridley's Legacy, both were good, but I would definitely do back repeatedly for the latter.",32,19,view review

37,,John V.,05/02/23,,,,3,"We had high expectations for this restaurant, but found it was hit or miss depending on the dish...

Oysters were ok, but found lots of small shell pieces and a bit gritty.

The old fashioned included pomegranate juice, which added a sweet flavor, but wasn't our favorite.

Cornbread was good & sharable size.

The shrimp and grits... spot on and would bring us back!

The burger was fine and the fries were tasty.

The service was a little off tonight. Nice people, but had to ask for our server a couple of times.",13,,view review
38,,Dave F.,25/02/23,,1,1,2,"In town with a work group, we had a large party totaling 18 people for dinner on 2/21/23. We were told The Ridley could accommodate, but we were given a special shortened menu, with limited selections. Each person was responsible for their dinner, state per diem rules. 
The location from our hotel was walking distance..perfect location. The ambiance was very nice. A few of us arrived early and had an adult beverage prior to dinner. Very nice and relaxing at the bar. 
Our large group arrived and was seated at two separate tables, with two completely different servers. So basically they broke us up into a party of 8? Which was surprising to me. So tell me why do we need to  order from shortened menu, with a party of 8? Servers wouldn't budge, even though we were now a party of 8 people, with 1 check for each group. Keep in mind we had 2 separate servers. Pretty disappointed with this process. 

Overall the food was average, nice portions. Our server was less than stellar, took along time to get our drinks to table and to take our order. I haf th cajun pasta and added blackened chicken. Food came, and the chicken was not blackened at all. Server made a comment it had sear marks..?  Our other group had some food cooking temp issues with chicken. Our group had to insist with their server it wasnt prepared to proper cooking temp and chicken had visible signs of red colors. The dish was Sent back to finish cooking and after 30 minutes passed the food came back out. By this time every person in the party had finished eating. This person was very upset and her server did nothing to make it right. 
I'm being very generous with a 2 star rating. I feel the setup for out group was not right..the service was less than adequate and the food prices for this lack of food options, quality and service was horrific. 
The Ridley was very disappointing for the amount of money being spent by their customers. 
Thank You

I asked her to make a different drink after I didn't care much for the menu one, and also had her heat up my gumbo after the waiter brought it barely warm.

48,,Charles N.,01/05/23,,,,2,"while the service was good and cheerful, the food was severely lacking. The roast Turkey club was meagre and tasteless. Accompanied by barely warm  fries, it was less than a bargain at 16.50. Even less worth the price at 18.00 a glass was the ""house"" pino grigio. 
With the nearby alternatives being student joints, I suppose they trade on being a place for ""grownups"". As well, with the other option being the medical center cafeteria, The Ridley has a somewhat captive audience. In sun, it was a case of not great  Charlottesville food at New York prices.",1,,view review
49,,Serena X.,05/05/23,,,,3,"First off, just want to say we had great service here. Our waiter was attentive and gave us wonderful wine and appetizer suggestions. The skillet cornbread and Brussels sprouts were delicious. However, I ordered the salmon with white beans for the main course, and it was unfortunately disappointing. The salmon was and beans were alright, but lacked flavor. The peas seemed undercooked and almost crispy? 

I also got a cheesecake for dessert to share, and it was nothing special, and not quite as rich as I would typically expect for cheesecake. I did appreciate how it wasn't too sweet. Overall would give them more of 2.5 - extremely pricy for the lack of quality.",229,132,view review
50,,Brett M.,09/05/23,,,,4,"The dinner service is amazing. I've been there 3 time this week to try different options and have not been disappointed. The filet mignon will melt in your mouth. The ribeye is well seasoned and paired with a great compound butter. The fat is perfectly rendered to melt and be absolutely delicious. Lastly, the bone-in pork chop. Again, perfectly cooked and the flavors from the sweet potato mash served on the side to its own honey glaze is paired so well. Make sure to order your drinks and grab some olives or oysters while you wait for your main course. The staff is friendly and attentive. Can answer or get the answer for any question you may have excellent recommendations if you want to try something new. The overall feel isn't that of a hotel restaurant. It feels very much upscale and yet affordable. I like how they break up the bar area from the main dining area. Creates a good feel dependent upon why you're going there.",21,,view review
51,,Bridget S.,13/05/23,,,,2,We came for a Mother's Day brunch. Party of 10 we all drive about an hour to get to Charlottesville and pick a different restaurant each year. I'm not sure if they were short handed but our waitress seemed hurried very rushed. She seemed short whenever a question was asked and not very friendly. Took at least 20 mins for anyone to greet us another 20 for water and then another 20 for our bar drinks. They were not very busy but from the amount of time it took for even a greeting you would think they were slammed. Food was ok not worth the money I think we spent.

I dug a little deeper and a lot of those reviews were at the bar, which makes sense.  We came in and it was like a ghost town, but everything took 20 minutes.  Drinks, order, food, check, check receipt....the servers were nice enough, but lacked direction.

The food was NOT good.  My chicken biscuit breakfast was fried within an inch of its life.  The avocado toast my wife had was ok, but the poached eggs were slimy.  My daughters French toast was the best part of the meal.

I would not come back here.  Nice enough people terrible food.",23,141,view review

The staff was young and inexperienced. Seemed like they were missing management. Food was a MAJOR disappointment. Brussel sprouts that seem to have been cooked earlier in the day and reheated. Shrimp and grits that were overly spicy and curdled. No creamy here. Cobb salad that was tasteless. Cornbread that was dense and undercooked. Again. Clearly precooked and reheated - or not reheated as the case may be.

Unique menu items: No
Ambiance: 3.5 out of 5
Service: 3 of 5
What would Gordon Ramsay say: "" #%!* Pathetic attempt at cooking classic dishes.""
Price for food quality: 1 of 5


There is nothing on this menu that stands out as unique. Nothing about the food seemed freshly made, which can be fine for some people. Seeing as this place is attached to a hotel, it makes sense why everything comes prepackaged and then assembled.


If you are an experienced eater desiring uniqueness and flavor, this isn't for you.

Seriously doubt there was a roux involved in this. The smoked corned beef sandwich was small with burnt bread and hardly any coleslaw on it. The meat did not taste smokey and it was fatty. As for the Ridley cocktail, and I really hate to criticize this drink, but it was so sour! All I tasted was pure lemon  juice. I actually put the sweetener my mom in law had in her purse  into the drink to make it palatable. Then added some water! Maybe it was just me, but I doubt it.

68,,David A.,16/09/23,,,,2,"Great atmosphere, coupled with decent food (albeit cold), wrapped up in inexperienced service, and washed down with horrendous drinks - David A.

I really try to avoid bad or even mid star reviews.  But my family and I are in town to celebrate a wedding and wanted to try The Ridley out for dinner.  

We were able to make a reservation on open table for a Friday night at the time we wanted which was great.  We were seated right away, and greeted with water and our waitress fairly quickly.

Hurriedly, she said she would be right back to take our drink order... at least 20 minutes later, we finally make eye contact and she rushes over and verbatim says ""I'm so sorry, I completely forgot about you"" .... yikes!

At this point we've wised up to what's going on and luckily knew to put our drink and dinner orders at the same time. 

We get the food before our drinks, never a good sign... my lobster roll was okay, but the fries were cold.  Dad's burger was good, cooked how he likes but nothing special, his fries were warm.  Mom's salad was good, but needed pepper, it took another 10 minutes to get our waitress to come back for something simple.

Finally, our drinks were made and brought out over 1/2 way through dinner (this is about 30 minutes after we've ordered them).  Again, our waitress rushes over ""I'm sorry for the delay, our bartenders are terrible"" sets the drinks down and then rushes off to God knows where, because she wasn't checking on other tables either. The thing I'd been looking forward to after a long day of travel was their Old Fashioned (my favorite and go to cocktail), presentation was good but the drink was unfortunately mixed terribly, took one sip and didn't touch the drink after.  For $21 you expect it to at least taste correct.

Another 15 minutes or so after we've finished our meal we have to flag her down yet again to get our check.  Another table locally was waiting to pay their bill for at least 20-25 minutes for her to come back. 

Overall, the experience was a letdown and I feel like with a different and more experienced waitress the meal and experience could have been salvaged.",16,63,view review

We came for the Christmas day prix fixe, and our 3:30 reservation took until almost 7. Considering the last seating was at 5, I felt awful for the staff.

We had intended to order a bottle of wine with dinner, and after-dinner cocktails, but when our pre-meal cocktails (an old fashioned and a straight whiskey - not exactly rocket science) took a half hour we decided to skip having any further drinks. 

The portions are large - a little too big for a high end coursed meal - but the food was good. Salmon was well cooked, but a little under-salted; the pasta was excellent.

For the first course, I tried the Fried Green Tomatoes. These were tasty and I would get these again. For the second course, I ordered the Bourbon Street Pasta with Blackened Salmon. The pasta was overcooked, but the blackened salmon was perfectly cooked. For the third course, the Creme Brulee was good, but I wasn't a fan of the cinnamon they added to it.

I called them directly and ordered a Caesar salad and a rib-eye, substitute asparagus for potatoes - pretty standard order. The woman who took my order was nice, which is half the reason for the second star.  I got a gruff return call about 10 minutes later from some guy.  First question: ""Did you order room service?"" Yes, I did. ""We are completely out of steaks, do you want anything else?""  Um you have like 5 entrees, how can you be out of one?  His answer: ""Well, everything is fresh.""  OK, makes no sense, they don't require advance prep just having them on hand, but whatever.  I asked for crab cakes instead.  He didn't respond, just hung up on me.  The food actually did arrive about 20 minutes later, but it was stone cold, the crab cake had so little crab it was more like a biscuit, no flavor, and there was no asparagus in sight.  The Caesar was worse than prepackaged salad, tasteless. The woman who delivered my order was nice too, which is the other half of the reason for the second star.

We decided to sit at the bar and although the place did not seem to be that busy, the bartender appeared to be overwhelmed. We ordered some cocktails; my wife's Pine Apple-lime martini was excellent, I on the other hand ordered a dirty martini and ended up with a less than dirty martini, if fact, no dirt at all. It was Belvedere Vodka, which on its own is good, the bar tender, although very nice, Houdini. The Oysters looked  appealing, we like them raw and at $32 for a dozen, and that they are shucked to order, have to be good right? Oysters are best served ""cold"", not luke warm, and normally on a bed of ""ice"". Secondly for $2.67 a piece, these Oysters were anemic, with no vinaigrette, crackers, etc. which the menu says come with them. The bottle of Prosecco helped wash them down. Ok, being adventurous, we pressed forward our drinks plus the Prosecco were kicking in. My wife ordered the Caesar salad with the shrimp which she said was delicious and I ordered the buffalo seasoned  cauliflower. Seasoning, ehhh, but the cauliflowers were good size. Desert martini was the ""Wahoo Daiquiri"", delicious. Moral of story .. stop in for a Signature Martini or Daiquiri, roll the dice on food, enjoy the ambiance.",32,28,view review

The hostess was very friendly in seating us and our server brought over water while the other member of my party had left the table. She stated she would return to introduce herself when he returned. He returned to the table and she didn't return for almost 10 minutes.  She took our drink orders and we ordered our appetizers. She returned several minutes later to let me know they were out of the items to make the extra credit passion fruit cocktail, so I ordered the wahoo daiquiri instead, my date had ordered an unsweetened tea; which had yet to arrive in this time frame. We sat and talked and waited for our appetizers to arrive. My drink arrived about 15 minutes later and we began to wonder about our food. At which time, we'd been waiting awhile since placing the order and had watched several couples/parties come in after us and get their appetizers by now. 45 minutes in to being there, we finally got our appetizers. The cornbread was hot and delicious. The shrimp cocktail was warm and slimy, not so great. We both ordered the chicken and waffles and it came out not long after our appetizers; which didn't surprise us. The chicken was hot and flavored well. The waffles had so much cinnamon butter on them, it made them cold to eat. But when put together, it wasn't bad. When it came time to order desert, one of the reasons I chose this specific restaurant for dinner, they stated they didn't have the crème brûlée that was on the restaurant week menu. That it hadn't set and wasn't available, so they could offer the banana pudding or a slice of cheesecake with berries. What a disappointment this was. After the terrible service we had, this just ruined any good that had come from the food. We ordered the cheesecake to go and when it came out in the to go containers, it was more of a sliver than a slice. It looked like they took a slice and cut it on half to share with two people. We paid our bill and asked the server for a bag to carry out the to go containers in and she stated she would be back with it, to which she never did. We had to ask her 3 additional times for the bag before we finally got one to use. This was one of the worst service experiences in dining I've had. The cornbread was amazing and I would come just for that. But the rest lacked anything to be desired. I understand things happen in a kitchen and places run out of things, but when it's restaurant week and you've posted a specific menu; that menu should be followed. If you're unable to, that should be stated upfront when your sat at the table, as they had known all day.

102,,Kristen D.,19/08/24,,,,1,"We will never dine here again - the only thing the Ridley has going for it is the ambiance. It is a really nice looking restaurant - but this is not a quality restaurant at all. The service was honestly despicable. I will note we had a party of 10, but even the small tables around us were complaining, and the restaurant was not even busy. The bad service was very clearly an ongoing issue and unrelated to our party size. Our server was extremely slow and never bothered to ask if we wanted refills. The kitchen was also bad. Everyone's meals came out at different times, and took forever. We were there just over two hours but not because we were leisurely enjoying our meals - over half our table got salads and two others got sandwiches and one set of ribs. While I could understand the ribs taking some time, they were actually the first out of the kitchen. One salad didn't even come until after everyone else had finished. I personally got a Caesar salad with steak cooked med rare. The steak was more well done and the salad wasn't even tossed and the dressing tasted like it had gone bad. Also of note, several people got the same salad, but they came out looking completely different. For example - two people got the beet salad but one came out in a large bowl and had goat cheese and other little bits but the other was on a small side plate without any cheese or anything. Same with the Caesar salads - all the plates were different. By the end, we could not wait to leave. For an Autograph Collection hotel, this restaurant was an absolute miss. Save your time while in Cville and avoid the Ridley - there are plenty of wonderful restaurants with solid service and great food!",61,,view review
103,,Ennis W.,22/08/24,,,,1,"My partner and I were there Wednesday evening, August 14. That was the fifth night of what was otherwise a truly wonderful road trip vacation. We stood waiting for probably 10 minutes before a sullen, shabbily dressed young woman arrived to seat us. She greeted us with attitude and one word ""Two?"" She grabbed two menus, whirled around and showed us to a tiny high top table. My partner asked if we could be seated at one of the two empty booths just 4 or 5 steps away. That's when the young woman's performance began. She charged off, returned with a wet rag and began furiously to clean both of the empty booths. Literally snarling, she seated us at one of the booths, and threw two menus on the table. Momentarily she returned and literally threw two small plates in front of us. Both of the plates actually bounced. She left and never returned, although she was racing around the nearly empty restaurant the entire time we were seated with no apparent purpose, obviously angry at the world, not just us. After we were seated, we waited another ten minutes before I got up to go find a server, as none had appeared. That server was lovely, kind and efficient.The food was okay, but the night was completely ruined for us by the hideous behavior of the hostess. I cannot remember a worse restaurant experience ever, anywhere. I would avoid this place. Period.",1,,view review
104,,Rusty R.,24/08/24,,,,1,"Shoulda went somewhere else, but it was across the street from the Courtyard Marriott and had a large crowd dining outside. Sat at the bar and looked at eh menu for 5-10 minutes with nothing looking good. Settled on a Grilled Chicken sandwich and swapped the fries for collard greens. Sandwich came with Mayo on it... Disgusting . Scraped off what I could and tried to eat it as I was hungry. Absolutely zero seasoning -no salt, no pepper, nothing. I don't even think it was grilled. Tried a bit of the collards and they were old and really shredded up. I love hot sauce, but someone had added some to this to cover how old they were. A 20oz Miller Lite (that smelled like a dirty dish towel) and a crappy chicken sandwich was $37. Run anywhere but here.",90,,view review

""I'm extremely disappointed and upset with my recent experience at The Ridley. As a service animal owner, I was mistreated and misled by the morning manager Brigitte . Despite informing them about my service animals, they failed to accommodate us properly . It's unacceptable for a business to be so ignorant and unaccommodating towards customers with disabilities.",5,,view review
106,,Connor B.,01/09/24,,,,5,"What a tremendous restaurant for many reasons. The braised lamb shank, exquisite taste. Our server, Shelley, learned all of our names in record time. She was awesome. The history of the establishment was impressive. We will all be back.",1,,view review
107,,Rhonda B.,15/09/24,,,,2,The restaurant was clean and the staff were very friendly.  That is the only thing good about this place!   WAY OVER PRICED FOOD!  We paid 70 for 2 chicken dinners.   The chicken was burnt and the serving sizes were small. One biscuit and a small portion of sweet potatoes and 2 stalks of asparagus.  If you like spicy burnt food. Eat here.   Could have gotten better food and cheaper food at Canes.  No wonder the dining room was empty. Should have taken that as a sign.,1,,view review
108,,Jamie P.,22/09/24,,,,1,"I made a reservation one month ago for this restaurant and was excited to experience the southern cuisine. We were seated in the bar area at a dirty table. About 10 minutes after seating we were greeted by our bartender/server who said "" sorry, usually they let us know if they seat these tables."" Certainly didn't make us feel welcome and it felt like our seating was an afterthought despite me making this reservation weeks in advance. The jalepeno cornbread was fine. I wish I could tell you how any of the other food was... but after 45 minutes of sitting and not placing our entree order we lost hope and flagged down the bartender to pay our bill. What a disappointment to a highly anticipated weekend in Charlottesville. Would not recommend.",8,,view review
109,,Brad H.,23/10/24,,,,1,"This place is over priced for what you get. $20 for a plain Ceasars Salad. We got there before dinner rush and it took a very long time to be served. Service was mediocre at best. Very loud atmosphere
 We ate there because we traveled all day and didn't want to drive anywhere.  BAD MISTAKE!!!",60,4,view review
110,,Jeff S.,26/10/24,,,,4,"The hotel and the restaurant/bar are great. I've been there three times, and unfortunately, each time, one of the bartenders (Savannah) comes across as a very unhappy and disagreeable person in general...both to customers and her coworkers. Lots of eye rolls, sighs, and general exasperation directed toward everyone.

Detwan was great and gave us friendly and excellent service. Smiling, happy, and accommodating of a special request we had.

We will certainly be back, but this comment needed to be written down.",1,,view review

Having conversation with her. She definitely will make us decide to wanna come back.",1,,view review
112,,Melanie M.,03/11/24,,,,1,"I've been to many restaurants across the country, and unfortunately, this was by far one of the worst brunch experiences I have ever had.

It took over 20 minutes from the time our group sat down to place an order. Our waiter was constantly nowhere to be found and it took forever to get his attention for anything. A table next to ours received their food before us despite the fact that they arrived after us. By the time our food eventually came, it was extremely cold and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while -- which wouldn't be a surprise since our waiter seemed to forget about our table altogether. And if that all wasn't enough, after we got our receipt (once we managed to get our waiter's attention), we realized that we were charged for TWO sandwiches despite only ordering one. Attaching the photo of our receipt here for proof since the restaurant refuses to answer their phone -- again, not a shocker. To top it all off, the delayed (lack of) service almost made us late for my friend's out-of-town departure.

Unless you are desperate for food and have no other options, do not come here. I cannot stress this enough.",6,,view review
113,,Sandy D.,09/11/24,,,,2,"Brunch is not what you want to experience at the Ridley.   Coffee is too strong and must have sat around.  After ordering we had to ask for the following, sugar, spoon, salt and pepper .  As if the waitron didn't check tables or do set up.  Meal was brought w incorrect sides and was underwhelming. Spoiled arugula on avocado toast was a bummer.  No worth $50 brunch.",56,23,view review

116,,Shenise F.,08/12/24,1,1,1,5,"I love when the richness of the origin story of a restaurant matches the delectable dishes that come out of the kitchen. 

This black owned restaurant located in Charlottesville, VA was named after Walter Ridley who was the first to receive an academic doctoral degree from the University of Virginia. 

As part of the Thompson Restaurant Group was familiar with the aesthetic and I was excited to experience the menu at this establishment. 

My order consisted of:

- Pineapple Lime Martini 
- Crispy Brussel Sprouts 
- Gumbo
- Collard Greens

Everything was beyond delicious and I would definitely comeback to order everything I ate again.",190,44,view review
117,,Bill D.,10/12/24,,,,2,Overpriced. $34 for an unremarkable shrimp and grits. We waited 45 minutes for our food. Several tables seated after us got their meals before us. Manager said she wasn't a cook and couldn't explain how the kitchen worked.,11,,view review
118,,Emma E.,13/12/24,,,,4,"I still think the Ridley is a good restaurant choice in cville - the food has been slightly inconsistent the few times I've been (same with the service) so knocking off a star. If you're in, ask for Angela - she's the best server they have!",249,18,view review
119,,Toni C.,22/12/24,,,,2,"Ambiance was great but the food was slacking. Started off with the Espresso Martini w/chocolate coca puffs on top, however it didn't come with the topping. Ordered the fried green tomatoes appetizer, the breading was thicker than the tomato so the tomatoes weren't cooked. Lastly the Mac and cheese didn't have any cheese but had a major helping of bread crumbs on top. Very disappointing food experience.",1,367,view review
120,,Wynkyn N.,04/01/25,,,,4,"We've eaten several times at the Ridley and can recommend it as a reliable restaurant inside the Draftsman. The seasonal cocktails change, but the rest of the menu is consistent each time we visit. The deviled eggs are worth trying! And the Brussels sprouts are a little spicy, in a good way.",4,,view review
