Angel H.,7/29/18 2:23,1,1,1,2,5,"Came here for drinks and really enjoyed the cocktails and appetizers! Service was on point and the ambiance was perfect. The restaurant decor is beautiful and the lighting was perfect. Bar seats were large and comfortable, too! 

I got the Riviera cocktail- a Bombay gin, Pimm's cup, lavender lemonade, and cucumber slices mix. Absolutely loved it! It tasted so refreshing in the summer heat. The Paasionera was great too, though a little strong for my taste. 

The complimentary hummus and bread was delicious. The bread was soft and the hummus was mixed just right. The bruschetta was beautifully prepped and very satisfying as well! Each slice of French bread had two giant chunks of mozzarella and tons of prosciutto. The dish went perfectly with the cocktails. We ended with the side of fries and were stuffed! It was a giant bowl of garlic and parsley seasoned fries- loved every bite of it! 

I can't wait to come back and try some of their entrees. 

Dinner is amazing!! The gazpacho was perfect! So refreshing and so full of flavor, the richness of the tomatoes was heavenly. The salad was fresh and the dressing was not too heavy. The grilled salmon was perfect. Every bite was fresh and the balance between crispy and tender was just right. The drink menu is extensive and dinner came with complimentary chocolate chip sea salt cookies! I love Orzo!",510,454
Rachel V.,8/3/18 2:18,0,0,0,3,5,"4.5 Stars really but generally close to 5 for sure!!

The only slight negative is the drinks seem to come out very s-l-o-w-l-y. Like 25 minutes after you order kinda slow. 

But, the good stuff:
-water refilled frequently 
-all food is fantastic- plated beautifully, tastes amazing, and very fresh! We shared the octopus salad, hubby had pasta Bolognese, and I had the steak and salad. 
-the limoncello basil drink is OFF THE CHARTS
-very friendly staff & management 
-fantastic place for a date! (BUT maybe not a first date cuz I think the MO is relax, enjoy, sip wine and if you don't click with a date it could be painful hahahha! But seriously this place is so cute. 

This restaurant is very reasonably priced for the quality & quantity of food you get. I WISH we could find such authentic, flavorful, and fresh food at these price points in DC. Most expensive entree was $28. Great selection!!",385,68
Owen B.,1/27/19 14:15,2,1,1,3,4,"We love Orzo.  We go there a lot.  The food is always very impressive and reasonably priced. Good cocktails, good service, and a comfortable atmosphere.  Last night we stopped in for Restaurant Week and tried some new things.  Their mussels are the best we've had and we order mussels a ton. Very traditional European style with a creamier broth and little bits of sausage and cheese.  Her salmon was perfectly grilled and super tasty, and my lamb shank was tender enough to eat with a spoon. 

My two gripes would be the olive oil poached tuna appetizer was really dry and likely way over cooked.  The dish was good, just the texture of the tuna unpleasant and kinda just  can-esque. 
Secondly the draught beer comes in these stupid champagne flute looking thing.  It holds maybe 8oz and each pour still costs $6....seems a bit bass akwards.  Use a normal pint glass please!",379,215
Ana D.,4/14/19 16:47,0,0,0,2,4,"Came here for a group dinner. There were 11 of us and they do take reservations. Had halloumi cheese and 18 month prosciutto for appetizers, they were both very good. 
If you like tequila, recommend the pasionaria drink, one of the most tasty drinks I've had in Charlottesville or ever. The rim is covered with a spicy powder (but not too spicy, just enough to be flavorful). 
I had the pork chop for dinner and it was not my favorite. It didn't have a bone. It was tender but, not enough sides in the dish, mostly just pork. 
Had the semisweet chocolate pot de creme for dessert and this was probably my favorite part of the meal. If you have a sweet tooth and love chocolate, definitely give this one a try. 
I would come back for the apps, the drinks, and the dessert. Would probably give another main dish a try.",280,235
Taylor R.,9/12/19 18:20,1,0,0,1,5,"We came here for dessert but dinner to go and both were amazing!! We got tiramisu and the bolognese for dinner. The pasta was a little spicy but soooooo good!! We brought our dog along and they treated him so well and brought him a little bowl of water which we were sitting on the patio. Overall great service, atmosphere, and food!",131,31
Morolake T.,10/16/19 20:51,1,1,1,1,3,"Came here with a group of four on a Tuesday evening. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. We started by devouring the complimentary bread and hummus and moved on to the Halloumi Cheese. It was really good--especially the sauce it sat in. We also shared the mussels--& wasn't a big fan of the broth. I'm not sure if it was because the cheese and fennel mix, but something was off.

I had the NY strip steak, and the double baked potatoes. They let me sub the broccoli for the Brussels sprouts. The Brussel sprouts In my meal were better than the ones that came as a side dish, but still not amazing.

The last time I was here I had the lamb and risotto, so I think they have a rotating menu. That lamb was amazing, so I was a little disappointed with this meal. It was a solid place to eat, and great mood setting, but nothing to call home about.",147,302
Vita W.,11/2/19 15:02,0,0,0,0,4,"-What you need to know in a sentence: Tasty ""creative"" Italian with an extensive wine menu for a nice meal out.
-Ambiance in threeish words: dimly lit but not quite romantic, warm but not quite homey
-Treated like: a polite coworker is making sure you're okay.
-Must try: halloumi cheese, chorizo & calamari pasta
-Other random tidbits: there's an outdoor area, although I've never sat there. Orzo is pretty accommodating with semi large parties",65,15
Christina Z.,4/14/20 23:24,1,1,1,2,5,"Update 4/2020: Orzo's Curbside Dinner Pickup helped us celebrate our anniversary at home in these times of social distancing. It's definitely a splurge option in terms of curbside dinner takeout ($20+ for most entrees) but it was a really nice way to enjoy a fancy dinner for a special occasion! Ordering online and the curbside pickup was very easy and allowed for contactless drop off in the car. 

For dinner, we shared 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, a dessert, and a bottle of wine. Plus we got 2 surprise chocolate chip cookies! Our favorite part was the 18 month prosciutto di Parma bruschetta - the bread was grilled without being too dry and absorbed the basil oil nicely and the creaminess of the mozzarella balanced the saltiness of the bread and prosciutto. The bolognese was delicious and meaty, and the steak was grilled nicely and came with potatoes and asparagus. For dessert, we had the olive oil rosemary cake which was light and not too sweet. Overall, it made for a lovely meal!",360,52
Catherine M.,8/3/20 15:44,0,0,0,1,4,"In the time of COVID, it was pretty hard to find a restaurant serving indoors and past 8PM. They accommodated our party and service was pretty quick and efficient. I am not sure if their menu is limited due to COVID but for a place that says it serves tapas, I was confused on their limited amount of tapas. I did like the patatas bravas as they were really spicy and perfectly cooked. I got spaghetti with meat sauce which was decent but nothing to write home about. Their sangria was good but definitely not the best. Overall, a pretty good date spot and would be interested in trying some of their other offerings.",1297,99
Jessi S.,9/20/20 11:29,2,0,0,5,4,"It was pretty difficult to get a reservation at a decent time while they are only operating at limited capacity. I found one of the hosts who answered the phone a bit rude and told me to do everything online (which I had already done, but had trouble modifying), luckily another host a different day worked with us. Our food was great, and despite mixed reviews on the haloumi cheese, we enjoyed it. The octopus salad was nothing impressive, but all the entrees were tasty. I was actually shocked by the price point and serving size and expected a bit more. And all the decent bottles of wines were $50+. My lamb shank ragout was the favorite- so tender! The strip steak came in close second in my opinion, and the sword fish and bucatini satisfied those who ordered them. And of course- there were no leftovers!",437,386
Mark G.,10/27/20 1:07,1,1,1,2,3,"A five minute drive from the Inn we are staying at while in the area for a few days. It is in the center of Old town Charlottesville. Parking was easy and free. We parked in the back and surprised some folks by entering in through the back door of the place. 

You could eat indoor or outside we chose outside on the smallish patio area about 6 tables right on the street. It was 64F a calm evening. There were two other groups out there. The inside was not too crowded but we did see many patrons waiting for their take out orders. It was about 645p on a Monday. 

Service was good. We ordered hummus & a Caesar salad to start and risotto pescatore and pork ragout pappardelle. The hummus was very good. My wife loved her risotto. She commented that this was one of the few places that removed the shell from the shrimp tails that she could remember. Seems every where we go from fancy to not the chefs never remove the shells from the tails.

My ragout was unremarkable. It was good enough for comfort food but could have used a bit more flavor. 

We got a few glasses of wine, an Albariño and a Nebbiolo. Both were good. 

It is a nice place for a decent meal. Total $144 with tip. Ok value. 

Mark & Nancy.",568,46
Hillary R.,12/11/20 1:16,0,0,0,1,5,"Cute, intimate little place. We had an early reservation and were the only people in the restaurant for awhile, but when other patrons came the staff was careful to seat diners beyond the social distancing guidelines. Felt completely safe the whole time.

The food was STELLAR! We had the duck breast, peasant beef, and cheese plate. Everything was delicious and left us wanting more. 

Our only regret was that we weren't there when the little market that it's connected to was open. We did end up going back to visit the bakery that shares a parking lot, but we will have to make another visit!",18,1
Julie S.,6/21/21 11:59,3,1,1,3,4,"Great dinner spot! We came here after seeing reviews and were not disappointed. 

We made reservations, but arrived early and they were able to seat us right away. 

Our server Annie was new on the job and apologized in advance but that was not needed as she was super sweet, attentive and helpful!

She brought out olives for us to enjoy before, but no bread since I let her know I was gluten free. 

For gluten free options, they do not have a gf pasta, but any of meats can be prepared gf and the risotto is gluten free. 

We enjoyed sangria and when Annie asked if we were from Cville, we told her no and we were visiting on vacation so she recommended several spots. 

My friend had the spring vegetable salad and loved the lentils on the salad and ate every bit of her Calamarata alla Norma.  I enjoyed the Risotto Primavara. 

The classic tiramisu was amazing! Light and fluffy and the coffee cut the sweet just enough. Highly recommend.",640,436
Tera C.,6/28/21 16:26,0,0,0,0,5,"My fiancé and I had our rehearsal dinner and wedding welcome party at Orzo this past weekend and we are so happy with how perfect the entire evening went!! Even though many restaurants are experiencing staffing shortages in this end of COVID era, Orzo's staff was an A+ team that made our night seamless. The food was absolutely delicious. Best tiramisu I have ever had. We received many compliments on the food, the wine, and local beer selection. The staff was professional, friendly and helpful. The Red Room space was perfect for our rehearsal dinner and the Galleria served as an excellent place to chat and drink with other wedding guests for the Welcome Party. We will definitely be going back next time we are in Charlottesville!!",1,6
Urvi P.,8/21/21 11:26,0,0,0,0,5,"Great local place to eat!  Has great food for vegetarian and meat eaters.  Got the opportunity to talk to Ken, the owner/bartender, who's a great guy and makes a mean margarita.  Will be back each visit to c'ville.",4,4
David L.,8/21/21 19:59,0,0,0,1,5,"We had a very pleasant dinner here after spending the day touring UVA. The service was warm and attentive, and most of the dishes we ordered were very enjoyable. Starters, including the hummus, local tomato gazpacho and the melon and cucumber salad were great. Really unique cool salad that really hit the spot on a hot and humid day. The Red Wine Braised Squid Pasta dish was also very good. A bit difficult to discern the individual ingredients, but the pasta rings were cooked perfectly and the sausage sauce was addictive.",397,35
N S.,9/7/21 4:24,0,0,0,0,4,Not a bad night considering it was dorm time in this town.  We were able to get a seat.  The food was all delicious and fresh.  Wonderful oil they use for dipping bread and spreads.  From the write up. 'S.   Interesting selection. Can't really remember my primary selection.  So it's really just average.  The wait staff is young and in training a few mistakes including the bill.  I anticipated more.  The picture says it all the bread was excellent.,430,2
Matt K.,9/21/21 10:26,0,0,0,0,4,"Red wine braised squid pasta was perfectly cooked, slight spicy note from the sausage addition. Was debating between this and the lamb dish, highly recommend this. For a pasta dish was very light. Not pictured was the appetizers and sides of hummus, baguette, black eye peas, and the bruschetta (also, get the bruschetta)!",56,25
Patrick L.,9/26/21 1:44,0,0,0,3,5,"Rarely does it happen that I clean my plate when dining out, but Orzo's food is so excellent I couldn't help myself.

We came here for date night, courtesy of a very generous wedding gift from the owners. The prosciutto bruschetta was exactly what I want an appetizer to be- tasty, but not filling to the point I'm not hungry for my entree.

The Lamb itself was superb. Lamb is my favorite meat, so I obviously have high standards for it. Orzo's dish was so tender I didn't even need a knife to cut it.

The service was outstanding as well. We got to make good conversation with one of the owners, who took great care to ensure our experience was rewarding-safe to say it was!",81,149
Sabrina D.,10/15/21 1:00,1,0,0,1,5,"One of the best experiences we've had in a long time! The food was excellent...prime sirloin to die for, drinks were strong and flavorful (the Pasionaria was a great twist on a margarita), and the olive oil rosemary cake was moist and tasty and not the same old thing. 
We also had excellent service. We sat outside with our dog and the staff were all friendly, fun, and accommodating to us and our pup. We'll definitely be back!",68,4
Jackie B.,10/29/21 2:49,1,0,0,2,5,"*4.5 Stars* So impressed with this place! Our party of 6 had an early dinner reservation, and we weren't quite hungry enough for a meal when we got there but somehow managed to eat a TON of food. It was that delicious! To be honest, nothing on the menu really stood out to me at first but EVERYTHING we ordered was so appetizing and amazing.

We started with the mussels as an appetizer and the broth was so rich and sausage-y. We also got the haloumi cheese and hummus apps... everything was sooo good that we ordered another full loaf of bread and oil to dip in all of the leftover broth, cheese, and hummus. Even the olive oil was the best oil I've ever tasted. Our sirloin steak, pork tenderloin, and rigatoni bolognese entrees were really great too and so flavorful. Tiramisu and drinks did not disappoint either, although I wasn't a big fan of the sangria. Would def come here again, and I found that this place was only one of a few that opens on Sunday and Monday evenings in Cville.",292,150
Jack R.,10/31/21 4:36,0,0,0,0,5,"We were visiting my son in Charlottesville and he recommended the Orzo for dinner so we gave it a try.  It was a great call!  I'm going to concentrate on my dish but before I do I just want to praise the hummus a bit.  We actually ordered two hummus dishes - we had one as an appetizer with the baguette, and my wife had a hummus order but substituted grilled flatbread instead of the baguette.  Haven't had hummus on a baguette before but it was fun and delicious.  Of course what made it great was the hummus - very flavorful, light and fresh.  We ate every drop of the hummus and all loved it.
 
My dish was the Smoked Pork Tenderloin.  It was fantastic.  The chef had laid down the butternut squash puree with the chili fennel rub/bulgur pilaf on top, and the green apple relish on the side (see photo).  I started with the rub/pilaf/puree and the explosion of flavors was just incredible.  So delicious!  And the apple relish had a wonderful, light, minty(?), refreshing flavor but was chopped into very small little cubes so that it was also a delight to chew.  Mixing the relish in with the rub/pilaf/puree was just a flavor smorgasbord.  

Then there was the tenderloin.  Very tender, not a bit of fat on it, cooked perfectly, and with a strong and delicious smoked flavor.  It would have been delicious all by itself, but with the accompanying delights just mentioned, it was out of the park!   Couldn't have been happier with the tenderloin, it was the best I've ever had.
 
The only knock I have on the Orzo was the list of entrees is a bit short.  I suspect they keep it short to concentrate on what they serve, and they did an outstanding job on my tenderloin, but newcomers may have an easier time selecting something with a couple more choices.  All in all, it was just outstanding and I can't wait to go back.",34,1
Hannah P.,11/5/21 23:27,0,0,0,0,5,"Went for a celebration dinner with my boyfriend and had their prosciutto bruschetta for app, peasant beef and pork bolognese and calamarata squid pasta with montepulciano wine, and their olive oil and Rosemary cake. 
Prosciutto bruschetta was SO good. A must have. I could've eaten only those for the whole meal and would be okay with that. My boyfriend had a bolognese which was very fragrant and yummy. The squid pasta was also very good. The squid was very tender and softer than the noodle. There was no fishy smell or taste and it paired very well with the wine that our waitress so kindly suggested to us. The cake was also very good and moist. It was served with lemon curd and whipped cream which felt like clouds. Overall food was amazing and service was also amazing, as our waitress continued to check in on us.",15,162
Jacq M.,11/17/21 20:01,1,0,0,0,5,"Food and service were awesome. Patio is a wonderful spot for people watching in downtown.  Decided to stop and eat here on our way to check-in to a local AirBnb. When we got there, we discovered this restaurant was also highly recommend by the cabin's owners as a local eatery. Serendipity!",20,4
J E.,11/18/21 22:28,4,0,0,4,5,"I came here one evening and sat at the bar for dinner. The bartender was great, very friendly and helpful and was very skillful with his cocktail skills! They have an interesting menu, loaded with some really nice Italian/Mediterranean style eats. Prices are decent, but on the slightly high side.

I started with their Greek salad from their specialty menu and it was outstanding! Next I moved on to their hummus, which comes with their freshly made baguette and it was great! The texture of the hummus was a little more coarse than I prefer, but the flavor was great and the baguette was excellent too.

Their Red Wine Braised, Calamarata Squid Pasta dish was very interesting! The taste and spice of chorizo and smoked paprika was mostly what I experienced and I really enjoyed it. The squid was cooked perfectly and wasn't hard nor rubbery. For dessert I enjoyed their Pot de crème and it was outstanding! While there I tried a glass of wine and a cocktail and enjoyed both.

Definitely would return!",2898,94
Sarah L.,11/21/21 17:26,0,0,0,2,4,"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary when we visited Charlottesville. The restaurant is connected to a small local market and there is plenty of parking in the back. We really enjoyed our experience here. we didn't know what to expect but the server was very friendly and kind. We ordered the steamed mussels which were DELICIOUS! we loved the sauce so much we asked for bread to dip it in. The cocktails were also very good. I had the Rivera and my boyfriend had the pomelo. If you like fruity cocktails the pomelo is what I would recommend. 
For our food we ordered the peasant beef pasta and the red wine braised lamb. I expected the lamb to be lamb chops but came out a little different. But none the less it was VERY tender and very yummy. The pasta was also tasty. 

For ambiance I would give it a 4/5
For food I give it 4.3/5
Service I give it a 4/5 

We would defiantly recommend this place for those who love both Italian and Mediterranean!",230,755
Alex W.,11/30/21 1:03,0,0,0,0,4,"4.5/5. The food, service, and ambiance was perfect to celebrate my 5 year anniversary with my girlfriend. The staff was super friendly and did a great job explaining all the specials for the night. We ended up starting with the mussels followed by the peasant beef and braised lamb. Everything was super delicious especially the sauce for the mussels. My girlfriend couldn't help ourselves and ordered bread just to dip it in that amazing sauce. Highly recommend this place to anyone!",85,487
Lina J.,1/2/22 20:40,1,0,0,2,5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlottesville so far. Orzo consistently has great food and I love how the selections change in the passport menu. For apps, you just have to get the haloumi cheese - it is SO good. I have also enjoyed every single entree I've ever tried here. It may not be on the menu anymore but the squid pasta was amazing *chef's kiss*! 

In the summer months, I love sitting outside on the patio. The lighting and plants make it a super cute little alcove to enjoy a fantastic meal in. I will be back often! The interior is cozy as well - I love the low lighting and color scheme. I will be back as often as I can!",272,206
Jennifer M.,1/27/22 22:21,2,0,0,0,5,"Orzo is one of our fave local restaurants! Their food is always solid. My fave is the spaghetti pomodoro.  The hummus and bread is incredible.  Just thinking about it makes me crave it! 

They have a good wine selection and a full bar.  One of the few places in town to carry Ken Wright, my fave vineyard/winemaker! 

If you haven't been recently definitely go check it out.  We love to sit at the bar and talk to the owner aka the bartender.  You know a restaurant is great when the owners take turns actually working in the restaurant.",165,26

The butternut squash soup was PERFECT! It was the perfect dish for a cold winter night for an app. I then ordered the steak which just melts in your mouth. I couldn't get enough.

After looking online we decided to try ORZO's since it was very close.  Upon arriving on a Tuesday night,  we were told all the tables were sold (we did not have a reservation) but the bar was available for dinner.  So we took two chairs at the bar and had the one of the most awesome dining experience's ever!!!!      The best part was the nice break between the appitizers and the entree.   Seems wherever we go the entree comes out right on top of the appetizer.  This place is run to perfection!!!  Food and drinks were Great!

Ryli C.,4/11/22 22:36,1,1,1,6,5,"Excellent experience here. From the friendly wait staff to the relaxing patio atmosphere, this checks off all the boxes. I keep telling myself to branch out to different types of cuisine and I'm glad I branched out with this  Mediterranean inspired fare. 

I took all the recommendations from the waiter (Nick I think his name was?) - the Pomelo cocktail, the lamb dish, and the Spanish olive oil & rosemary dessert. All *chefs kiss* delicious. I probably wouldn't have chosen any of these just by looking at the menu, but so glad it's what I ended with. 

Reservations are recommended - I grabbed one at 5:15 and it filled up pretty quick after I sat down. 

Just can't say enough good things about this place.",200,44

Can't recommend it enough!",594,142
Kelsey W.,6/19/22 14:01,0,0,0,1,5,"This was our first time dining at Orzo and it was simply incredible! The main thing we raved about (both during and long after dinner) was how flavorful all of the food was. 

The Food
Our sever recommended the grilled halloumi cheese and I would be lying if I said we still aren't thinking about it 3 days later. Such a unique and delicious dish--I wound up drinking the remaining broth with a spoon, it was THAT good! I indulged in the summer orecchiette pasta which was so light and flavorful with delightful pops of broccolini, tomato, and chickpeas. The lemon ricotta was subtle and added just enough creaminess to the dish without making it too overwhelming. My boyfriend ordered the spice rubbed pork chop and we both agreed it was the most delicious pork chop we've ever tasted! The crunchy sear bursting with flavor perfectly complimented the juicy interior--it was quite an experience. We also had a small tray of appetizers olives which will surpass anything you'll buy jarred in a grocery store. I could have snacked on them all day. We wrapped up dinner with a classic tiramisu, perfectly portioned to share between the two of us. Lastly, I ordered the Napoleon's Loss cocktail with perfect ratios of tequila, ginger, and lemon. A nice heavy pour and tasty candied ginger garnish--delish! 

The Service
We absolutely loved our server and I am so sad I don't remember his name. He was so pleasant, accommodating, and knowledgeable of the menu. We have absolutely no complaints. Early in the night, a different server dropped off a drink saying it was the Napoleon's Loss, but within seconds of me about to sip it, I believe it was the manager who ran over and told me it was wrong drink and quickly went to get me the right one. The level that the staff cares about their customers was abundantly clear, and we felt very well taken care of.

The Space
Parking was a breeze. We parked in the lot next to the building and didn't have any issues finding a spot at 6:30pm on a Friday. There was a shaded patio which looked airy and fun, but I had made our reservation for inside. The inside was intimate in appearance and a little loud with the acoustics, but it was not difficult to still enjoy our anniversary date. 

Thank you so much, Orzo, for a wonderful experience! We can't wait to come back the next time we are in Charlottesville.",245,319
Christy B.,7/6/22 18:43,0,0,0,2,4,Great covered outdoor patio. Tons of free parking in the adjacent lot. The lamb ($30) was incredibly tender but could've used a bit more seasoning to balance out the sweetness of the figs. The bolognese ($19) was delicious and perfectly al dente. The burrata ($12) over a bed of farro with a balsamic glaze was a good starter to share. Tiramisu ($8) was the best thing we ordered.  Incredibly light and airy in texture.,112,268
Bri J.,7/27/22 14:40,0,0,0,1,5,"Came in with two friends for a dinner with reservations on the patio. Staff was friendly. I had the steak, which did take awhile to prepare as stated on the menu.

All of us had tasty meals and left very full and happy with our meals. Prices competitive, but overall bill felt high. Definitely a get what you pay for situation -- and in this case it was a truly delicious dinner.",458,112
Lisa G.,8/2/22 12:34,1,0,0,1,4,"Delicious food, good service and nice atmosphere. We chose this for a Friday night on a girls' weekend trip and vibe felt just right.  The pace is pretty slow, which was fine for our group. 

One reason this loses a star is two of us ordered cocktails that weren't great. I got the pasionaria, which is somewhat like a margarita with tequila, elderwater flower liquor and rimmed in harissa salt. I didn't like the salt at all and would have greatly preferred a simpler margarita. My friend got the ravello and she didn't like it. I took one sip and it jerked me back; I was expecting a strong lemon flavor but it was just like an alcohol burn without any pleasant flavor. 

Now, the peasant beef and pork bolognese was so good! The portion was smaller than I expected (all entree servings were), but it was rich and enough for me and I would definitely order again.

For dessert, we shared a chocolate pot de creme and omg! Again, it looked pretty small to share at our table, but it was so rich. I think I made a verbal yum sound after each bite.",215,13
Karey M.,9/16/22 21:33,0,2,2,0,1,"Was excited to try this place. Walked in about 4:15. First person to speak to us was over by the bar and we asked him innocuously whether we could sit anywhere.  He said, in a rude tone, ""Nope.""  I felt a little awkward and asked if we should sit outside. He said, ""I am giving you an option.""  I asked to sit at the bar.  We felt so put off and dazed. 

I worked in the restaurant service for several years. I understand what it's like when patrons are rude or entitled. For what it's worth, we were not like that. We just walked inside a dark and totally unoccupied restaurant. Not another soul around. 

Whatever we did when we entered made that individual quite annoyed. Or maybe he was already annoyed. We will not be back because of it. 

Turns out he was the OWNER!!!  

Shame on him. Food and wine was not worth making to feel like we were second-class citizens.",19,0

Been there 15 min before ""do you know what you want because we have large parties coming in."" Well you know what Orzo?

Emma E.,1/10/23 2:05,0,0,0,2,4,"I have to knock Orzo down a peg because I just feel like the food we've had recently hasn't been as good as it used to be.

We came in recently for a date night, and noticed the food hasn't quite kept up. The grilled halloumi cheese appetizer was fabulous, but the entrees leave much to be desired. We had the lamb shank bourguignon and the grilled prime sirloin steak and unfortunately both were just meh. The lamb was cooked very well, but our overall impression was they were both pretty boring. The flavors were run of the mill. I will dream about the pork medallions I had last year - one of the best meals I've had. Until that comes back, the rest of their entrees seem to be good, but not great.

The service continues to be fabulous, every time I've been our server has been great. I have noticed other reviews that have commented on the host being rude, and have noted this in interactions with other guests.

The only reason I am giving Orzo four starts is due to the lamb. I love lamb and was excited to try the dish.

This isn't the only establishment I've been to thay foes this but I'll never understand places that charge close to $30+ for pasta and give a small portion so that was off putting.

It's always been very tasty -- well-prepared, properly seasoned, and hot. The bruschetta appetizer is especially delicious. I get it every time. But something was different about this last visit. We arrived 12 minutes early for our 7:30 reservation, and were told quite firmly that we would be seated no earlier than 7:30. Ok, not a problem. So we sat at the completely empty bar to wait the 12 minutes. The host then offered my wife a menu, which she declined. The host then said it won't get us seated any faster. Really? Why are you treating us like we did something wrong? It's not like we were 12 minutes LATE for the reservation. Thank you but we can do without the attitude. Once seated, we decided to order our appetizers while we decided on the entrees. The waiter told us we couldn't do that. He said we had to order everything at the same time. Seriously? In decades of dining out, I've never had that happen before. While the food is excellent, we prefer to dine somewhere where we feel welcome.

They even printed the menus as placecards and allowed me to customize the heading, which was such a special touch. Our group was seated in a private loft area which made the dinner so intimate and special. Service was amazing, friendly, and attentive, which just added to making the night so special.

Sunny H.,7/31/23 15:04,0,0,0,1,3,"The food is food and I appreciate the nonstandard menu. I ordered the Go Fig or Go home mocktail, primarily because there was fig in it but I did not detect any fig flavor. It was still tasty though like a refreshing fizzy water, but not fig water. My recommendation to the restaurant when making this mocktail, however, is to please stir the drink before serving it or suggest the patron stir it. When I took my first couple sips, all I tasted was bland soda water. It wasn't until I stirred the drink several times when I finally tasted what I think it was supposed to taste like.

I had the Shawarma Spiced Grilled Fish of the Night which was swordfish. That was done very nicely since swordfish tends to be a bit of a dense fish. It wasn't dry at all and the rub they used was delicious. I don't like fish (only ordered it because I thought it'd be a healthy choice, but I liked this dish.  I also enjoyed the sweet potato that came with it. The sweet potatoes are a few thick round slices of sweet potato that were naturally sweet. I could have done without the beet tzatziki though. I think it was the color (pink like pepto bismol). It made sense that it was pink because tzatziki is white and beets are a dark red, but still, the color looked very unnatural. 

I can see why the Peasant Beef & Pork Bolognese is ordered often. It was quite good, and the portion size was just right.

The ambiance was a bit distracting. The restaurant  inside what looked like what used to be a hangar or warehouse, so when you look up, instead of seeing a ceiling, you see a curved metal roof. There is an open kitchen concept but perhaps a bit too open for me, as if the team was cooking feet away from you in the same room but not in a kitchen. The lighting could also be better. It was a bit too dim/dark, and the dark colored wood furnishings did not help.

I found the service distracting as well. Our server placed two small plates in front of us (presumably for our appetizers). Shortly thereafter, another server came up to ours and whispered to him with a disapproving facial expression and pointed to our table. This exchange occurred directly in front of me. The other server then removed those two plates without comment. I expected a ""pardon my reach"" or ""excuse me"" or ""I'm sorry, these plates were not supposed to be placed on your table."" Also, two different people brought our food to the table. Each person had a ""I'd much rather be somewhere else"" or ""this is such a chore"" expression on their faces.

Outdoor seating is available though it didn't look like there was much a view for outdoor dining ambiance. There's a busy street in front and orange construction barriers line the outside dining border.",357,3

Better impression: appetizers comes out within 5-10 mins after being ordered, in a packed-from-the-back-to-front of restaurant. Classic Minestrone Soup? Delicious. 18 Month Prosciutto di Parma Bruschetta? Freakin better than any bruschetta I've had in the past 2 years. 

Entrees were what stood out to me. 

Spaghetti pomodoro was just perfect. Balanced. Frequent hits of Basil touched the palate. Banger dish. 

Grilled Marinated Pork Tenderloin with whatever the hell dried cherry mostardo is (later I found out it's basically fruit and mustard), delicious. Oh and there's a hidden layer of smoked aioli. SMOKED AIOLI freakin smacked me in the face. The entire plate was cohesive af. 

Dessert. 
-Pot de creme: simple with two ingredients yet so so good. I'm going to attempt to recreate this at home. 
-Spanish Olive Oil & Rosemary Cake with the lemon curd. To die for.

Prosciutto bruschetta: can't go wrong with this! Crunchy bread, good presentation, really flavorful

peasant beef and pork bolognese: great pasta texture and even spread of meat, flavorful, definitely my favorite of the night

grilled fish: happened to be salmon, which was super tender. came with some tomato slices and potato, which was a great add on. really delicious, but wish there was a bit more fish for the cost

riviera: me and bf thought it was okay, not too strong. warning that once it dilutes it tastes like cucumber water though!

Service - 5/5
The waiting staff was attentive, helpful, and friendly. When our waiter was busy, others checked in regularly and offered refills and made sure we had what we needed. 

Food - 3/5
I enjoyed my appetizer. I had the seared halloumi. My partner had a Caesar salad. My entree was a bit of a letdown. I ordered the spaghetti Bolognese and, honestly, I was disappointed with what I got for the price point. The sauce was nothing spectacular. My partner's salmon was undercooked. It was okay in terms of flavor, but wasn't that impressive. I had a Riviera cocktail. It wasn't my favorite, but it was alright and refreshing. 

Price - 2/5
For what we got, I think the final check was a little steep. The food was just okay. We were expecting to spend about what we did, but we were expecting to enjoy it more. 

Ambiance - 3/5
We were seated very close to another couple, even though there were other tables that would've given us more space and privacy. The music and background noise drowned out the other conversation. Then again, we just talked as if they weren't there. Maybe they spoke less because we were right before them.

The pork medallions were exceptional.

Great Choice for dinner!",150,2
Savannah D.,4/28/24 19:25,0,0,0,0,4,"Orzo Kitchen and Wine Bar earns 4-stars for its delightful service and welcoming ambience reminiscent of an Italian trattoria. The table shared, flavorful Halloumi garnished with roasted tomato and basil and the Lebanese Muhammara Dip (roasted red pepper & walnut) with za'atar flatbread, which stole the spotlight. 

For mains, they have a rotating menu of Mediterranean specialties, one if which was the Shawarma-Spiced Grilled Salmon paired with savory za'atar grilled sweet potatoes, creamy baba ghanoush, and tangy beet tzatziki. The Peasant Beef & Pork Bolognese, a cherished family recipe, added layers of taste and tradition to the meal. It's no surprise that this special has been on the menu for 20 years, as each bite exuded warmth and depth of flavor.",52,130
Dan K.,5/2/24 2:45,0,0,0,0,5,Two of us popped in on a Sunday evening for a bite.  Sat at the bar and had a wonderful meal at the bar which is our favorite place to sit in most restaurants.  Great food and service.  Perfect evening!,15,0
Emily L.,5/9/24 23:15,1,0,0,1,5,So amazing from staff to food. Very clean restaurant with nice seating. The olive oil is super authentic and the chicken with potatoes was so tasty. We came as a huge group but they were super organized. I wish I got to try some of their authentic Mediterranean but it was definitely a place to go. Nice outdoor seating available as well.,258,20
Jae C.,5/19/24 14:39,0,0,0,0,1,"I recently went to Orzo with my family and made a review describing my experience, and the reply from Orzo was ""I think you have the wrong restaurant"". I'm sorry, is Orzo not the unexciting Mediterranean restaurant on W. Main st.? The same restaurant that is too small to fit all of its guest so they open up the middle of the waiting room of Feast to sit their guests? Is this the same restaurant with only one working bathroom not situated inside of the restaurant? Is Orzo not the restaurant that offers chewy and utterly inedible steak? The only meal that fits right in is the Peasant Beef and Pork Bolognese, because I sure felt like a peasant eating here. Next time don't deflect and own up to your bad service so maybe people can have more of a tolerable time. Thank you Orzo for having an unwelcoming and quite nasty atmosphere giving me my final reason to write this review.",1,0
Amy D.,6/26/24 13:14,0,0,0,0,3,"Meh. We were at another restaurant having drinks and decided to hoof it over here bc the pasta was supposed to be amazing... We will never know. Sat at the bar and ordered a glass of rosé, which was sensational btw, but when we first sat down the bartender was pretty short. We sat down and he said ""I'm not ready for you yet"" and walked away. It was really odd. I understand that you have a full bar and you're very busy but just communicate properly "" hey guys, welcome in, I'm working on a couple drinks right now, do you mind if I come back down to you in a minute?"" that's all that needed to be said not, ""I'm not ready for you.""

When he came back and I got the sensational glass of rosé, we were ready to put in our appetizer before deciding on our main entrée. We ordered the appetizer and then asked us what we'd like for our entrée, we said we're still debating the entrée and will order later, he said ok and walked away. Two minutes later he came back and asked ""are you ready to order your entrée"", and we replied ""no we're going to wait until we have our appetizer and then we'll put in our entrée."" He said "" I have to put it all in at once so I'm not gonna put your appetizer in until you order your entrée"". So strange since we were both sitting there waiting on the appetizer we thought we had put in ... If he hadn't informed us of this we would've been waiting a long time! I complained about it to the woman sitting next to me, who was listening to the entire transaction, just shrugged. This was the second ding she heard me mention about our short time there.

The bartender could send the dissatisfaction of having to order everything at once and then started to explain that it's because the kitchen gets backed up and when you put in your appetizer and entrée separately it kicks back to square one and it could take 45 minutes to come out. Again, if that has been communicated at the beginning of ordering, this wouldn't have been an issue. It's like when you go to a Spanish restaurant, and they tell you the paella will take 45 minutes to cook so that you have an expectation. Just communicate.

It gets weirder! Right after this interaction, while sitting at the bar, I started to draft my Yelp review.  I even pushed back a bit and held my phone at an angle so the bartender didn't see as to not be rude. As I'm in the middle of drafting my yelp review, the host looks over and says ""what are you writing? ""And I didn't know how to respond so I said ""my yelp review ... what are you writing"" and then in what seemed like a power-play, he said btw I'm the owner and have you met my wife... She's sitting right next to you. Apparently, I was sitting next to his wife and daughter at the bar the whole time and she was the one I mentioning the bartender was being rude and that I couldn't believe we had to put our whole order in at one time. 
In that moment, I was so taken aback by his comment on my yelp review and then making me feel so awkward with his ""power-play "". But in true fashion, I dug back in and told his wife ""I don't regret what I said / the bartender was curt and it's ridiculous to have to order everything at once, that's not what dining out is about and it doesn't make it enjoyable. Further had he just communicated properly then it would have been a perfectly pleasant experience"".  

We stayed to finish our drinks and I continue to have conversation with his wife and daughter to smooth the air a bit, but at the end of the day we decided to not have dinner or an appetizer, pay for our drinks, and head out!",307,167

I docked a star because it was soooo hot inside. I know it's summer but I was sweating and was very uncomfortable. I also docked a star because the drinks were weak.

We came to celebrate our anniversary and they acknowledged it right when we got there. Our waiter recommended a fabulous wine that both me and the fiancé were raving about! Wonderful for people who like sweeter wines. Our appetizers were the halloumi cheese and it's was yummy but only comes with two pieces of bread so we also got a half baguette which was so good we wished we'd gotten a whole! The entree and dessert were so delicious! The parking was full at the market so we parked at a garage on Water Street, a 9 minute walk but easier than finding parking there.

Walking in on a Saturday evening, there were 3 of us without a reservation, but that didn't seem like an issue as we were seated almost immediately. The ambiance and aesthetics were nice!

We all ordered our own entree, but we started off with the hummus which came with some nice warm bread. It wasn't pita bread so I was surprised, but it tasted really good. My friend was right about the hummus, it was definitely a hit! I can see why he will just go to Orzo sometimes for the hummus only.

For my entree, I ordered the Saffron Risotto which can be tricky to make, but once again, a hit! Orzo really made it taste great and it was a perfect sized portion as well.

I did not try and of the drinks or the desert this time around, but I look forward to trying these on my next visit!",123,20
