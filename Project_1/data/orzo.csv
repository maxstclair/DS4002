I got the Riviera cocktail- a Bombay gin, Pimm's cup, lavender lemonade, and cucumber slices mix. Absolutely loved it! It tasted so refreshing in the summer heat. The Paasionera was great too, though a little strong for my taste. 

The complimentary hummus and bread was delicious. The bread was soft and the hummus was mixed just right. The bruschetta was beautifully prepped and very satisfying as well! Each slice of French bread had two giant chunks of mozzarella and tons of prosciutto. The dish went perfectly with the cocktails. We ended with the side of fries and were stuffed! It was a giant bowl of garlic and parsley seasoned fries- loved every bite of it! 

I can't wait to come back and try some of their entrees. 

Dinner is amazing!! The gazpacho was perfect! So refreshing and so full of flavor, the richness of the tomatoes was heavenly. The salad was fresh and the dressing was not too heavy. The grilled salmon was perfect. Every bite was fresh and the balance between crispy and tender was just right. The drink menu is extensive and dinner came with complimentary chocolate chip sea salt cookies! I love Orzo!",510,454,STRj5yYm51v2dooHmIYLpQ,"Newark, NJ",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=STRj5yYm51v2dooHmIYLpQ,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/5yE2H_9aZhhlxWAxoyDCoQ/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/orzo-kitchen-and-wine-bar-charlottesville?hrid=

The only slight negative is the drinks seem to come out very s-l-o-w-l-y. Like 25 minutes after you order kinda slow. 

But, the good stuff:
-water refilled frequently 
-all food is fantastic- plated beautifully, tastes amazing, and very fresh! We shared the octopus salad, hubby had pasta Bolognese, and I had the steak and salad. 
-the limoncello basil drink is OFF THE CHARTS
-very friendly staff & management 
-fantastic place for a date! (BUT maybe not a first date cuz I think the MO is relax, enjoy, sip wine and if you don't click with a date it could be painful hahahha! But seriously this place is so cute. 

This restaurant is very reasonably priced for the quality & quantity of food you get. I WISH we could find such authentic, flavorful, and fresh food at these price points in DC. Most expensive entree was $28.

Last night we stopped in for Restaurant Week and tried some new things.  Their mussels are the best we've had and we order mussels a ton. Very traditional European style with a creamier broth and little bits of sausage and cheese.  Her salmon was perfectly grilled and super tasty, and my lamb shank was tender enough to eat with a spoon. 

My two gripes would be the olive oil poached tuna appetizer was really dry and likely way over cooked.  The dish was good, just the texture of the tuna unpleasant and kinda just  can-esque. 
Secondly the draught beer comes in these stupid champagne flute looking thing.  It holds maybe 8oz and each pour still costs $6....seems a bit bass akwards.

If you like tequila, recommend the pasionaria drink, one of the most tasty drinks I've had in Charlottesville or ever. The rim is covered with a spicy powder (but not too spicy, just enough to be flavorful). 
I had the pork chop for dinner and it was not my favorite. It didn't have a bone. It was tender but, not enough sides in the dish, mostly just pork. 
Had the semisweet chocolate pot de creme for dessert and this was probably my favorite part of the meal. If you have a sweet tooth and love chocolate, definitely give this one a try.

I had the NY strip steak, and the double baked potatoes. They let me sub the broccoli for the Brussels sprouts. The Brussel sprouts In my meal were better than the ones that came as a side dish, but still not amazing.

Ordering online and the curbside pickup was very easy and allowed for contactless drop off in the car. 

For dinner, we shared 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, a dessert, and a bottle of wine. Plus we got 2 surprise chocolate chip cookies! Our favorite part was the 18 month prosciutto di Parma bruschetta - the bread was grilled without being too dry and absorbed the basil oil nicely and the creaminess of the mozzarella balanced the saltiness of the bread and prosciutto. The bolognese was delicious and meaty, and the steak was grilled nicely and came with potatoes and asparagus. For dessert, we had the olive oil rosemary cake which was light and not too sweet.

Parking was easy and free. We parked in the back and surprised some folks by entering in through the back door of the place. 

You could eat indoor or outside we chose outside on the smallish patio area about 6 tables right on the street. It was 64F a calm evening. There were two other groups out there. The inside was not too crowded but we did see many patrons waiting for their take out orders. It was about 645p on a Monday. 

Service was good. We ordered hummus & a Caesar salad to start and risotto pescatore and pork ragout pappardelle. The hummus was very good. My wife loved her risotto. She commented that this was one of the few places that removed the shell from the shrimp tails that she could remember. Seems every where we go from fancy to not the chefs never remove the shells from the tails.

My ragout was unremarkable. It was good enough for comfort food but could have used a bit more flavor. 

We got a few glasses of wine, an Albariño and a Nebbiolo. Both were good.

I'm going to concentrate on my dish but before I do I just want to praise the hummus a bit.  We actually ordered two hummus dishes - we had one as an appetizer with the baguette, and my wife had a hummus order but substituted grilled flatbread instead of the baguette.  Haven't had hummus on a baguette before but it was fun and delicious.  Of course what made it great was the hummus - very flavorful, light and fresh.  We ate every drop of the hummus and all loved it.
 
My dish was the Smoked Pork Tenderloin.  It was fantastic.  The chef had laid down the butternut squash puree with the chili fennel rub/bulgur pilaf on top, and the green apple relish on the side (see photo).  I started with the rub/pilaf/puree and the explosion of flavors was just incredible.  So delicious!  And the apple relish had a wonderful, light, minty(?), refreshing flavor but was chopped into very small little cubes so that it was also a delight to chew.  Mixing the relish in with the rub/pilaf/puree was just a flavor smorgasbord.  

Then there was the tenderloin.  Very tender, not a bit of fat on it, cooked perfectly, and with a strong and delicious smoked flavor.  It would have been delicious all by itself, but with the accompanying delights just mentioned, it was out of the park!   Couldn't have been happier with the tenderloin, it was the best I've ever had.
 
The only knock I have on the Orzo was the list of entrees is a bit short.  I suspect they keep it short to concentrate on what they serve, and they did an outstanding job on my tenderloin, but newcomers may have an easier time selecting something with a couple more choices.

They have an interesting menu, loaded with some really nice Italian/Mediterranean style eats. Prices are decent, but on the slightly high side.

I started with their Greek salad from their specialty menu and it was outstanding! Next I moved on to their hummus, which comes with their freshly made baguette and it was great! The texture of the hummus was a little more coarse than I prefer, but the flavor was great and the baguette was excellent too.

Their Red Wine Braised, Calamarata Squid Pasta dish was very interesting! The taste and spice of chorizo and smoked paprika was mostly what I experienced and I really enjoyed it. The squid was cooked perfectly and wasn't hard nor rubbery. For dessert I enjoyed their Pot de crème and it was outstanding! While there I tried a glass of wine and a cocktail and enjoyed both.

The Food
Our sever recommended the grilled halloumi cheese and I would be lying if I said we still aren't thinking about it 3 days later. Such a unique and delicious dish--I wound up drinking the remaining broth with a spoon, it was THAT good! I indulged in the summer orecchiette pasta which was so light and flavorful with delightful pops of broccolini, tomato, and chickpeas. The lemon ricotta was subtle and added just enough creaminess to the dish without making it too overwhelming. My boyfriend ordered the spice rubbed pork chop and we both agreed it was the most delicious pork chop we've ever tasted! The crunchy sear bursting with flavor perfectly complimented the juicy interior--it was quite an experience. We also had a small tray of appetizers olives which will surpass anything you'll buy jarred in a grocery store. I could have snacked on them all day. We wrapped up dinner with a classic tiramisu, perfectly portioned to share between the two of us. Lastly, I ordered the Napoleon's Loss cocktail with perfect ratios of tequila, ginger, and lemon. A nice heavy pour and tasty candied ginger garnish--delish! 

The Service
We absolutely loved our server and I am so sad I don't remember his name. He was so pleasant, accommodating, and knowledgeable of the menu. We have absolutely no complaints. Early in the night, a different server dropped off a drink saying it was the Napoleon's Loss, but within seconds of me about to sip it, I believe it was the manager who ran over and told me it was wrong drink and quickly went to get me the right one. The level that the staff cares about their customers was abundantly clear, and we felt very well taken care of.

The Space
Parking was a breeze. We parked in the lot next to the building and didn't have any issues finding a spot at 6:30pm on a Friday. There was a shaded patio which looked airy and fun, but I had made our reservation for inside. The inside was intimate in appearance and a little loud with the acoustics, but it was not difficult to still enjoy our anniversary date.

One reason this loses a star is two of us ordered cocktails that weren't great. I got the pasionaria, which is somewhat like a margarita with tequila, elderwater flower liquor and rimmed in harissa salt. I didn't like the salt at all and would have greatly preferred a simpler margarita. My friend got the ravello and she didn't like it. I took one sip and it jerked me back; I was expecting a strong lemon flavor but it was just like an alcohol burn without any pleasant flavor. 

Now, the peasant beef and pork bolognese was so good! The portion was smaller than I expected (all entree servings were), but it was rich and enough for me and I would definitely order again.

I ordered the Go Fig or Go home mocktail, primarily because there was fig in it but I did not detect any fig flavor. It was still tasty though like a refreshing fizzy water, but not fig water. My recommendation to the restaurant when making this mocktail, however, is to please stir the drink before serving it or suggest the patron stir it. When I took my first couple sips, all I tasted was bland soda water. It wasn't until I stirred the drink several times when I finally tasted what I think it was supposed to taste like.

I had the Shawarma Spiced Grilled Fish of the Night which was swordfish. That was done very nicely since swordfish tends to be a bit of a dense fish. It wasn't dry at all and the rub they used was delicious. I don't like fish (only ordered it because I thought it'd be a healthy choice, but I liked this dish.  I also enjoyed the sweet potato that came with it. The sweet potatoes are a few thick round slices of sweet potato that were naturally sweet. I could have done without the beet tzatziki though. I think it was the color (pink like pepto bismol). It made sense that it was pink because tzatziki is white and beets are a dark red, but still, the color looked very unnatural. 

I can see why the Peasant Beef & Pork Bolognese is ordered often. It was quite good, and the portion size was just right.

The ambiance was a bit distracting. The restaurant  inside what looked like what used to be a hangar or warehouse, so when you look up, instead of seeing a ceiling, you see a curved metal roof. There is an open kitchen concept but perhaps a bit too open for me, as if the team was cooking feet away from you in the same room but not in a kitchen. The lighting could also be better. It was a bit too dim/dark, and the dark colored wood furnishings did not help.

I found the service distracting as well. Our server placed two small plates in front of us (presumably for our appetizers). Shortly thereafter, another server came up to ours and whispered to him with a disapproving facial expression and pointed to our table. This exchange occurred directly in front of me. The other server then removed those two plates without comment. I expected a ""pardon my reach"" or ""excuse me"" or ""I'm sorry, these plates were not supposed to be placed on your table."" Also, two different people brought our food to the table. Each person had a ""I'd much rather be somewhere else"" or ""this is such a chore"" expression on their faces.

Better impression: appetizers comes out within 5-10 mins after being ordered, in a packed-from-the-back-to-front of restaurant. Classic Minestrone Soup? Delicious. 18 Month Prosciutto di Parma Bruschetta? Freakin better than any bruschetta I've had in the past 2 years. 

Entrees were what stood out to me. 

Spaghetti pomodoro was just perfect. Balanced. Frequent hits of Basil touched the palate. Banger dish. 

Grilled Marinated Pork Tenderloin with whatever the hell dried cherry mostardo is (later I found out it's basically fruit and mustard), delicious. Oh and there's a hidden layer of smoked aioli. SMOKED AIOLI freakin smacked me in the face. The entire plate was cohesive af. 

Dessert. 
-Pot de creme: simple with two ingredients yet so so good. I'm going to attempt to recreate this at home.

Service - 5/5
The waiting staff was attentive, helpful, and friendly. When our waiter was busy, others checked in regularly and offered refills and made sure we had what we needed. 

Food - 3/5
I enjoyed my appetizer. I had the seared halloumi. My partner had a Caesar salad. My entree was a bit of a letdown. I ordered the spaghetti Bolognese and, honestly, I was disappointed with what I got for the price point. The sauce was nothing spectacular. My partner's salmon was undercooked. It was okay in terms of flavor, but wasn't that impressive. I had a Riviera cocktail. It wasn't my favorite, but it was alright and refreshing. 

Price - 2/5
For what we got, I think the final check was a little steep. The food was just okay. We were expecting to spend about what we did, but we were expecting to enjoy it more.

99,,"Amy D.","2024-06-26 13:14:39",0,0,0,0,3,"Meh. We were at another restaurant having drinks and decided to hoof it over here bc the pasta was supposed to be amazing... We will never know. Sat at the bar and ordered a glass of rosé, which was sensational btw, but when we first sat down the bartender was pretty short. We sat down and he said ""I'm not ready for you yet"" and walked away. It was really odd. I understand that you have a full bar and you're very busy but just communicate properly "" hey guys, welcome in, I'm working on a couple drinks right now, do you mind if I come back down to you in a minute?"" that's all that needed to be said not, ""I'm not ready for you.""

When he came back and I got the sensational glass of rosé, we were ready to put in our appetizer before deciding on our main entrée. We ordered the appetizer and then asked us what we'd like for our entrée, we said we're still debating the entrée and will order later, he said ok and walked away. Two minutes later he came back and asked ""are you ready to order your entrée"", and we replied ""no we're going to wait until we have our appetizer and then we'll put in our entrée."" He said "" I have to put it all in at once so I'm not gonna put your appetizer in until you order your entrée"". So strange since we were both sitting there waiting on the appetizer we thought we had put in ... If he hadn't informed us of this we would've been waiting a long time! I complained about it to the woman sitting next to me, who was listening to the entire transaction, just shrugged. This was the second ding she heard me mention about our short time there.

The bartender could send the dissatisfaction of having to order everything at once and then started to explain that it's because the kitchen gets backed up and when you put in your appetizer and entrée separately it kicks back to square one and it could take 45 minutes to come out. Again, if that has been communicated at the beginning of ordering, this wouldn't have been an issue. It's like when you go to a Spanish restaurant, and they tell you the paella will take 45 minutes to cook so that you have an expectation. Just communicate.

It gets weirder! Right after this interaction, while sitting at the bar, I started to draft my Yelp review.  I even pushed back a bit and held my phone at an angle so the bartender didn't see as to not be rude. As I'm in the middle of drafting my yelp review, the host looks over and says ""what are you writing? ""And I didn't know how to respond so I said ""my yelp review ... what are you writing"" and then in what seemed like a power-play, he said btw I'm the owner and have you met my wife... She's sitting right next to you. Apparently, I was sitting next to his wife and daughter at the bar the whole time and she was the one I mentioning the bartender was being rude and that I couldn't believe we had to put our whole order in at one time. 
In that moment, I was so taken aback by his comment on my yelp review and then making me feel so awkward with his ""power-play "". But in true fashion, I dug back in and told his wife ""I don't regret what I said / the bartender was curt and it's ridiculous to have to order everything at once, that's not what dining out is about and it doesn't make it enjoyable. Further had he just communicated properly then it would have been a perfectly pleasant experience"".  

We stayed to finish our drinks and I continue to have conversation with his wife and daughter to smooth the air a bit, but at the end of the day we decided to not have dinner or an appetizer, pay for our drinks, and head out!",307,167,yqpdw4vGA37F2u4mWqz2Tw,"Alexandria, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yqpdw4vGA37F2u4mWqz2Tw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/PRkz2MAKo3JY3jXWJIjlSA/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/orzo-kitchen-and-wine-bar-charlottesville?hrid=

Wonderful for people who like sweeter wines. Our appetizers were the halloumi cheese and it's was yummy but only comes with two pieces of bread so we also got a half baguette which was so good we wished we'd gotten a whole! The entree and dessert were so delicious! The parking was full at the market so we parked at a garage on Water Street, a 9 minute walk but easier than finding parking there.

Walking in on a Saturday evening, there were 3 of us without a reservation, but that didn't seem like an issue as we were seated almost immediately. The ambiance and aesthetics were nice!

We all ordered our own entree, but we started off with the hummus which came with some nice warm bread. It wasn't pita bread so I was surprised, but it tasted really good. My friend was right about the hummus, it was definitely a hit! I can see why he will just go to Orzo sometimes for the hummus only.

For my entree, I ordered the Saffron Risotto which can be tricky to make, but once again, a hit! Orzo really made it taste great and it was a perfect sized portion as well.

I did not try and of the drinks or the desert this time around, but I look forward to trying these on my next visit!",123,20,lSarVSKEyRe8jOn6W_XuLA,"Charlottesville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=lSarVSKEyRe8jOn6W_XuLA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/oHyB366UwRePfY4MrVVv6g/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/orzo-kitchen-and-wine-bar-charlottesville?hrid=
