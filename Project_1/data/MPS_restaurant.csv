2008-08-29 00:00:00,5.0,"Love this restaurant.  The menu changes in little ways each day so check out what they have to offer on their website and find a day that sounds especially good to you.  If you notice something that repeats often with minor changes - it's probably delicious, if it's something new on the menu that you don't see on the rotation - it could be hit or miss but it'll probably be a hit.  

The parmesan or herb crusted lamb are always great choices for the rib eye and the cheesecake I had from there was amazing.  

No reservations but if you get there a little early on a weekday, you shouldn't have too many problems.  Also, although the menu looks intimidating and fancy, it really is a casual restaurant.",13.0,Duners
2009-03-26 00:00:00,5.0,"A daily menu with lots of choices!  Food was great!  One of the best restaurants around.  The second 5 star I have ever given to restaurants around Cville..Would definitely come back and visit again...

Came here after snowboarding at wintergreen... was a little bit under dress.... most people are dressed casual...but the atmosphere and food would ask for more...

They dont take reservations... so be prepared to wait during peak hours... but its definitely worth the drive and wait...",38.0,Duners
2009-06-05 00:00:00,5.0,"Fabulous!  I love this place - fantastic food with beautiful presentation.  We had the mussels and fried oysters to start followed by the soft shell crab and flank steak.  The mussels were the best part and are some of the best I've had.  

The wine list is pretty extensive and has a nice selection as well.

The best part is its location and interior.  For the price one would expect a much more formal setting, but the restaurant is quite casual and makes for much more relaxing experience.",228.0,Duners
2009-08-11 00:00:00,5.0,"This was a hard decision between 4 and 5 stars. It wasn't perfect... but if I'm honest, for the area... this actually is perfect.  

First, the food was dead on.  From the bread, to the salad, to the steak, it was all flavored beautifully and expertly from a true professional... not someone who wanted to make mass-produced comfort food, but someone who wanted to make delicious, complex yet accessible food.  Who can't get on board with that?

The atmosphere was a bit more dingy than i was led to believe from previous reviews.  It looks and feels almost like a diner that spent a few hundred bucks trying to make it look nice within an evening.  Like trying to set up for a dinner party in a rundown shack with only a few hours to prepare.  Reminds me of an episode of I Love Lucy or something.  It works here though, it keeps a casual, comfortable, yet open atmosphere that prepares you for a high-class, freshly prepared meal.  Perfect for Charlottesville.

The drink list is extensive, and the wine list is as well.  The desserts are ok, but nothing too exciting.  

The service is outstanding by the way.  A knock on the place is that while it isn't 'expensive,' it is a bit more than you'd find anywhere else in this area.  Still going to be pricey, but just to summarize the argument, its 100% worth it.

Its a great place, and much much more than you could realistically expect out of such a place.  This place is somewhere you can go to several times a week, or just once and always be satisfied and content.  Its a great place to be.  If you're out in this area, don't bother going anywhere else.",87.0,Duners
2009-09-02 00:00:00,5.0,"With Duner's, it's all about the food.  This venerable Ivy restaurant does not boast an elegant dining room.  The casual wait staff does not fawn over or pamper its guests.  And the kitchen abstains from over-the-top trendy creative culinary endeavors.  Instead, Duner's focuses - and delivers - on sourcing outstanding ingredients and skillfully preparing confident, delicious fine dining dishes.  

Open nightly for dinner from 5 'til 10, Duner's consists of a main dining room featuring booths along two walls and four-top tables in the middle.  There's a smaller dining room to the right.  The décor and place settings are somewhat plain and Spartan but its comfortable nonetheless.  

The menu is created daily based upon the kitchen's ingredients and whims of the chef.  It typically consists of nearly a dozen choices of both appetizers ($8 to $9) and entrees ($19 to $26).  Vegetarian and pasta dishes are always offered as well as sandwiches ($11).  

The challenge is choosing among the wonderfully tempting and deliciously composed dishes.  On a recent experience, we struggled mightily to select our meal.  From the appetizers, we narrowed it down to a short-list of choices that included house-made gnocchi, grilled scallops, steamed mussels and tempura soft shell crab.  We decided on the grilled scallops which were served with a basil and lime cream sauce.  

The scallops were expertly prepared: sweet and plump, well seasoned and perfectly cooked to an ideal consistency.  Sadly, too many kitchens destroy this delicate ingredient through overcooking or allowing the just-cooked scallops to sit too long on the plate before being served, resulting in something that's at-best dry or at-worst rubbery.  The dish was served with a sublime sauce whose richness and slight hint of citrus nicely complimented the caramelized, salty outer surface of the scallop.  

The same dilemma faced us for our entrée selections.  In the running were crabcakes, soft shell crabs, snapper and beef tenderloin.  Our waitress offered that the chef excelled at fish, so that helped to slightly narrow it down for us.  My dining companion chose the snapper which was flash-fried whole and beautifully presented surrounded by pepper sambal (or relish).  We tend to grill fish whole, so taking the flesh off the bone was not disconcerting at all.  The fish tasted very fresh and the simplicity of the preparation allowed the ingredient to stand alone.  The relish, was arranged along the circumference of the plate in alternating palettes of red and yellow - a beautiful visual rendering of summer colors.  

I chose the soft shell crabs which were - hands down - the best soft shells I've ever had.  First and foremost, they were incredibly fresh, lacking that ""fishy"" taste one often experiences with soft shells.  That's because it's difficult to get really fresh ones: it requires timing and precision from waterman to processor, distributor and chef.  To be sure, the little devils must be eaten within two days of crawling out of its hard shell.  Duner's sourced these crabs brilliantly.  Not only were the crabs fresh but they were also prepared beautifully.  Expertly flash-fried, still-crisp and, mercifully, not the least bit oily.  The only other place in Charlottesville that has mastered frying at this level of sophistication is Bang! (at least the last time we dined there).  The crabs were served perched upon a warm ""salad"" consisting of potatoes, corn and avocado which was ""dressed"" with a creamy herb and bacon sauce.  The dish had the dichotomic distinction of being both delicate and decadent.  Truly outstanding.        

Duner's offers a nice selection of beer, wine and booze.  A rose, offered by the glass, paired well with our selections and its light hue looked lovely in the glass.  We completed the meal with espresso which was strong but thankfully lacked the obnoxious bitterness of some shots.

Duner's does not accept reservations, so pick the day and time you visit carefully.  Or, stop in, add your name to the list and order a drink at the bar, or wait outside and make friends with others seeking a table.  Dress is casual - you'll see everything from suits and dresses to jeans, shorts golf shirts and sundresses.   

At Duner's the food does the talking.  Bravo!  One of our best meals of the year!",59.0,Duners
2009-09-28 00:00:00,4.0,"Very tasty meal. Went intent on getting seafood and they had a fairly wide variety available.

Started out with the butternut squash soup, which was very thick (which is good) and more filling than it appears. Plus, on the cold and rainy day we went, it was very warming. It's topped with crème fraîche and sage which gave it a richer, deeper flavor.

For appetizers we had the mussels and also the scallops. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the ancho & mushroom sauce was spicy without being overwhelming. The mussels, I don't know how you review mussels, except that they didn't give me food poisoning. I try not to look at them too much when I eat them, but I enjoyed the taste.

For the main meal we split the entree of crab cakes, which were awesome. It was like they just took a handful of crab meat, battered it up and fried it. No filler. The mashed potatoes and cole slaw on the side were both nicely done.

And our waitress, in splitting the meal, nicely gave us both full portions of the sides along with our individual crab cake. I thought that was pretty cool, and they didn't charge extra for it.

The potatoes were creamy, no lumps. The cole slaw was finely shredded and not creamy. Just a nice vinegary pepper taste.

Also on the side they give you a scoop of tartar sauce nearly the same size as the crab cake. I don't know who eats that much tartar sauce, but the little bit I had was a-ok.

The salad I could have either done without or had earlier in the meal, but it honestly had no real impact on my enjoyment.

For service, our waitress was very attentive, glasses were refilled often enough without it being intrusive and fresh bread (which was actually fresh baked) was brought without asking and refilled when low.

Overall a very enjoyable experience, which yes is kind of pricey, but I've also spent double that elsewhere for pretty near the same level of quality.",10.0,Duners
2009-10-13 00:00:00,4.0,"Duner's is an interesting place.  It's like going to a big family gathering where everyone pulls out the card tables and gets served an amazing meal.  It's no frills- the atmosphere is white tablecloth but cheap wooden chairs.  You can pony up to the bar on $10 wooden stools.  But the food makes it all worth while.  It's a great menu that includes several fish dishes (grouper, flounder, salmon), pork, duck, lamb and a handful of steak options.  There was also some pasta and a vegetarian dish. All are fairly classic in approach- nothing wacky.  I had the lamb - it was seasoned very nicely and cooked to order.  It was a lot of food- I received 7 ribs in a red wine reduction over a roasted red pepper crepe.  Very nice.  My wife had a beef tenderloin with bleu cheese.  It was rich and decadent.

The reasons for 4 stars and not 5 were really the ambiance and the dessert.  Desserts were a bit lacking.  But overall its probably one of the better meals in the area and I'd go back again.  My tab with one appetizer, 2 glasses of wine, 2 entrees and 2 desserts was about $100 even.  So pretty good value too.

So put it on your list if you're in the area.  And yes, be sure to enjoy the painting behind the bar.",31.0,Duners
2010-12-04 00:00:00,5.0,"Hand's down our favorite restaurant in Charlottesville. For around $60 you can have an excellent meal (complete with appetizer, salad, entrees and beverage) which is a great deal considering the superb quality and imagination of the dishes here. Go early though because there will be a wait!",207.0,Duners
2011-06-01 00:00:00,2.0,"Everyone's favorite restaurant in Charlottesville is not mine. It is a definite 2, not a 3.

I ordered flank steak and when it was delivered to the table it was luke warm, at best. Anyone who knows me knows I like my hot food HOT - who wants cold beef? The waitress took the plate away and ten minutes later served me a ""new"" dish, which consisted of the same meat, reheated. Not only was I disturbed by this, but the meat was now way overcooked. The flavor was decent, but the chewy factor ruined the dish for me.

What Duner's does do well is their homemade ranch dressing and brussel sprouts - I was impressed with those items. I had heard the bread was amazing, but, truth be told, it was a muted version of some type of Pillsbury dough.

We decided to order dessert - a brownie coffee-ice cream sandwich. I am not sure where they put the coffee flavoring, but where that was lacking there was a cup of chocolate syrup to try to make up for it - it was smothered.

All in I would give Duner's another chance, but my expectations would be much lower. It is likely one of Charlottesville's best restaurants, but I'm not sure that's saying much...",120.0,Duners
2012-08-31 00:00:00,5.0,"In the middle of my host's vehement discussion on the differences between regular cow and the tragic, glorious Texan longhorn, I looked up from my plate for the first time that evening. Yes I should have been paying more attention but it always feels so weird to be staring at someone whilst chewing, and so I listened with one ear open and the other senses completely fixated on my food. Much like a potbelly pig does. 

Scallops were divine. I had no idea something that came from the butt of a mollusk could taste so good. I've been watching Hell's Kitchen on repeat, and it boggles my mind how badly trained chefs can burn, over-season, under-season, and otherwise mutilate a poor little scallop. I would tell you to just come here and order two plates of the scallops and not to share with anyone, no, not even your children, because they're that delicious. The tomato/mozz plate was your typical kind of yum (with LOCAL tomatoes - so local, they were planted, plucked, and nurtured from someone's backyard). 

I got the grilled hanger steak. Nice to see that it came slightly bloody in the middle. I wish they gave me more roasted potatoes, though, because those micro-roasted tubers were awesome. I think someone asked me if they could have half of one, and I was like ... you can have the skin? I know, I am dreadful. 

Food came fast; wine and water continuously replenished. One thing that did grate a bit on my nerves was that the waitress had no idea of how to gracefully interrupt a conversation with some update on the food. We would be in the middle of something, and she would just lean her head way in and start rambling or stick her arm across someone's plate to reach the wine. Granted, the table we were seated at was a bit awkward to navigate, but she was so obtrusive! Otherwise, a magnificent dining experience.",1420.0,Duners
2012-09-02 00:00:00,3.0,"I want to love Duner's, I really do. I've been there maybe 10 times in the last 2 years, because it's convenient, and because the very first time I went, I had a pasta dish that knocked my socks off. I've been trying, in vain, to recreate that first magical meal.
Duner's seems to be somewhat hit or miss. The food is never BAD, it just often misses the mark, especially on the main courses. I can't figure out exactly what the problem is, but my dining partner agrees completely. Often it seems like a dish is missing maybe just one ingredient that could have pulled the rest of the dish together, instead leaving you with something that seems like it should be great, but instead came out just ok.

Also, the salad dressings are often pretty poor. Avoid anything that sounds a little more exotic, and stick with ranch or something else basic. I've had a feta-basil dressing and a green goddess dressing that were just awful.

The best things on the menu are the appetizers, which are consistently excellent. The fried panko oysters and the steamed mussels are excellent. The homemade bread is great. Soups are also good--their gumbo is outstanding.

Also, we had a dessert there recently that was out of this world--Warm apple crisp with pecan streusel topping, whipped cream, and vanilla sauce. Best dessert I've ever eaten. Kudos to their pastry chef.

A few other criticisms: they're going to charge the prices they do, they really need to update the interior of the place. The booths are really old, scarred up, and uncomfortable; the flooring is outdated and grungy, and the bar badly needs to be replaced.  At the very least, they need a paint job in there. I hate paying $70 plus dollars for a meal for two in an interior that deserves about $15.  It's also incredibly crowded in there if you sit at a table and not a booth. 
And finally, the service varies wildly. We've had nice waitstaff, and borderline rude waitstaff. In general, it's also slow, so don't go if you're in a hurry.",15.0,Duners
2014-05-11 00:00:00,5.0,"We wanted to try this place over 4 years now but always been too hungry to wait for a table for an hour...this time we got there late (8:15pm) we ""only"" waited 25 mins for our table. It worth every second of wait. 

They have a reasonably good wine selection with very reasonable pricing. 

The chicken flatbread was a great appetizer for 3. 

I had the veal sweetbread with caramelized onion and smoked bacon mashed potato  and my date/husband :) ordered the seared salmon. Both entrees were phenomenal!!!

Bottom line, eat a late afternoon snack before you go to hold you over the long wait. But every second of wait worth it! Promise!!!",31.0,Duners

2015-08-29 00:00:00,4.0,"Duner's is a little bit of a drive out of the city down Ivy Road but is a Charlottesville staple. It was highly recommended by several people, so we decided to go there for a nice birthday meal for my boyfriend. It's a pretty cozy place, and the parking lot was full, so I was a bit worried we weren't going to be able to get a table. There was only one available when we walked in, so they were able to seat us right away. Just a note, they do not take reservations.

They have white cloth tables, so it feels like you are dining at a fancy place, but the ambiance created is a little bit off. The tables are pretty close together, and they need better lighting or something. I'm one that goes to a place more for the food than the ambiance, so I was okay with it. They served us warm homemade bread with butter while we were pouring over the menu. There were so many great options and the menu changes daily, so I couldn't plan out what to order ahead of time, and I had a very hard time narrowing down what I wanted!

We ordered a bottle of malbec from Mendoza. The appetizers were the easy part to agree on--we went with fried oysters and fried green tomatoes (a little birthday tradition of ours). The malbec was meh, but the starters were amazing. I loved the aoili that was paired with both dishes, and they complemented each other well. I'm on kind of a fried oyster kick, and these were awesome! Each entree comes with a side salad, and the dressings are all made in house. I went with the Russian and was slightly disappointed by it. For my main, I finally settled on the tuna. I ordered it chef's choice, and it was cooked slightly more than I would have preferred it. It was served over tasso, mushroom, potato, and kalmata olive hash. The hash was such an interesting combination of flavors, and the dish itself was super rich. The dish was done really well, but I couldn't decide if I liked the unique flavors. Now, thinking back to this dish, I actually really, really liked it. My boyfriend ordered the veal scaloppini and was a big fan.

2016-08-30 00:00:00,4.0,My husband and I really enjoyed our meal at Duner's.  The appetizers were very good.  We each ordered our own and we DEFINITELY should have just split one because they are enormous.  Big enough for an entree.  As a result I was a little full by the time my entree arrived.  My husband loved his steak with blue cheese and garlic glaze.  I had the Veal and pasta dish which was good but had a little too much parmesan for my taste.  It made the dish a little gritty.  The service was excellent and accommodating.  We would return.,398.0,Duners
2016-11-25 00:00:00,4.0,"After driving by Duners many many times, we finally one night made the trip out so we could end the ritual of pointing and saying we needed to visit as we drove by. 

First impressions were positive of the very quaint building that wasn't fancy but had a clean, dressed up diner feel. I'm still unsure, but it seemed as though some people had reservations even though when I called I was told no reservations were taken. No worries, the bar and the very pleasant bartender was a nice place to wait as we started a bottle of wine. One thing that we both found interesting was that every patron seemed to also be eligible for AARP benefits.... they clearly had a target audience but it made it a much nicer, quiet ambiance. 

The menu was clearly seafood focused, but had a variety for all palates. The fried oysters appetizer was the highlight of the meal! I'm personally a raw oysters fan, but for the GF who isn't they were a good compromise. Our entrees were good, and the wait staff was pleasant. 

Overall I'd say this was a standard, typical dinning experience. It was good food, expected bill of just over $100 before tip (bottle of wine included), but without reservations and the drive out of Cville I don't expect to be back more than a couple times a year. 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to 4 since it's nice to see somewhere focused towards locals and regulars.",160.0,Duners

The place has been around forever -- and the latest chef is adding some interesting flavors to the old standards - fair amount of both asian and latin flavors

The menu is more of less the same each night -- crab cakes, Salmon, some white fish, trout, chicken, duck, pork chop, ribeye -- but 3 or 4 times a week the preparation is changed.

Desserts are great and the nightly wine specials are usually a good bet

I started with an order of four large grilled scallops in a perfectly spicy mango jalapeño sauce and the BBQ shrimp on spinach pierogis (sounds odd but absolutely delicious!). We also had fresh tuna, rockfish appetizer, delicious crab cakes, and fresh trout, but the star was the Beef Tenderloin with Warm Blue Cheese, smashed  potatoes and a red wine-bacon reduction.

The service was impeccable and we lacked for absolutely nothing.

Some dishes that I recommend are the oyster appetizer, which comes fried golden brown with a great remoulade sauce, the homemade fettuccini with signature Italian sausage in a fragrant tomato creen sauce, the savory, herbed roasted duck, and the veal scallopini.

We started with a massive bowl of mussels in a garlic butter wine sauce. The mussels themselves were super fresh and huge. Great appetizer to share.  We also had a few draft beers from Devils BB. 

I had Crispy Fried Whole Flounder with korean bbq dippin sauce over veggie lo-mein.  Talk about unique!  I've never seen a full flounder on a menu.... snapper sure, but not flounder. Overall the dish was awesome and this was perfect. The crispy skin was the best part.  I found the korean bbq sauce to be very salty and acidic and didn't use any of it; however, the dish didnt need any extra sauce/flavor. 

She ordered the seared salmon over spinach and potato gnocchi with prosciutto and corn.  The fish was perfectly cooked, buttery and delicious, Overall the plate was incredibly rich and succulent and she scarfed it down in about 1.5 seconds. Hey, it was her birthday.....

Their dipping sauce was a garlic butter with horseradish. I had their rockfish with spinach gnocchi and bacon. My friend had their Ahi tuna with Asian flavored noodles.

2018-02-19 00:00:00,5.0,"Don't let the facade and casual ambiance fool you, Duners serves delicious fine dining comparable or even better than some of the most popular places on the Downtown Mall. With a rotating daily menu, food is prepared based on what's in season, and it's done very well. My husband and I are happy that we decided to come here for a special occasion. 

We shared the calamari which was lightly breaded and came with a ginger wasabi dipping sauce - a pleasant change from typical marinara or aioli sauces. I got the seared salmon, and it was perfectly cooked (not dry at all and with just the right amount of lemon beurre blanc sauce) and was accompanied by housemade gnocchi. My husband had the ribeye which was prepared at the perfect medium rare and upgraded to the special vegetable side of brussel sprouts and spinach.

Overall, deliciously prepared dishes, nice staff, extensive wine list, and lovely but not stuffy ambiance. Definitely one of our new favorite restaurants for special dinners in the area! I would recommend booking a reservation because it is unsurprisingly packed on the weekends!",360.0,Duners
2018-04-06 00:00:00,5.0,"Wow!!! Best dining in Charlottesville. The food here is better than Hamilton and Main, better than C&O, better than Public Fish...I could go on and on. I visited on a weeknight about 8:30. So, I didn't have to face the crowd. There was no wait. I still decided to sit at the bar. I started with the Brussels sprouts dish. It's not on the appetizer menu. It's listed as a side at the bottom of the menu. This was the star of the night for me. Most Brussels sprout dishes are roasted and have smoky flavors. Duners' take on Brussel sprouts was a subtlety bold flavor. And I imagine they were braised. It had delicious broth and was cooked with spinach...man so good.  Next, I had a house salad, which comes with the entree, and the house bread. I believe the bread is a sourdough. It was really warm and doughy just like I like my bread. Soooo yummy. The salad was standard fare.  I wished they tossed the salad for you. It would have made it easier to eat (the salad comes with a dollop of the dressing on top of the bed of greens). But once I tossed the salad and cut up the huge leaves, twas delicious!!! I had my salad with the mustard vinegariette. It was perfect. I really had a hard time picking an entree because everything looked delicious. But I went with the tenderloin and potatoes. Really really good choice. The star of that dish to me were actually the onions that accompanied the dish. But I love onions. I topped the night off with the dome cake which is best if you have someone to share it with. It's huge!!!! Totally forgot to take a picture. I said all of that to say Duners is phenomenal and is probably the only place among the top tier restaurants in Charlottesville that I would visit again. It's that good!",339.0,Duners

Those are my only two downfalls about this place. I would definitely visit again if I were in the area. We had a house salad to begin. Shortly after there was calamari for the appetizer.

The fried oysters were so juicy and perfectly seasoned, with a balancing and tasty, tangy aioli. Had seared rockfish with pesto gnocchi, roasted tomatoes and buttered corn purée as my entree.
Seriously, it was to die for. The fish was perfectly cooked and the dish had all the right notes. It was rich and filling, comforting and everything I needed in that moment. Husband had homemade fettuccini with duck meatballs and mushroom spinach cream sauce. Suuuuppppeerrrr delicious. Who knew that duck meatballs could be so perfect? 
Apparently Duner's, and they are doing it right. The atmosphere is comfortable, not stuffy, and the staff are very attentive, a total win-win.

The inside has wooden booths and while you may see someone in a suit you may see someone in a T-shirt and jeans. It's casual and unpretentious. Moreover, the service is fantastic and will make you feel at home. 

I usually get something different each time I come. One thing I have been getting more consistently is the calamari appetizer. It is lightly fried with a delicious sauce.

The food was incredible--the menu was so diverse and had so many tasty options.  We had the mussels which were mind blowing.  We always order mussels on any menu and we agreed that these were probably the best we have ever had overall.  You could drink the delicious broth they are cooked in or just soak the wonderful House made bread in it and eat it like we did.  

They gave us complimentary champagne and pumpkin cheesecake which was totally unnecessary but speaks to the thoughtfulness of this restaurants staff and ownership.  We had another dinner the next day at another respected restaurant and it was such a let down after Duner's.  The wine list here is delicious and fairly priced.

The breading on the veal was soggy and fell off as soon as you attempted to cut it. Then a arugula salad was plated on top of the hot pasta that came with the veal, leaving it wilted and soggy.

I was surprised at how many menu choices were no longer available that day and when you look forward to trying something, its absence dampens your enthusiasm for the meal.  I found the soup a little bland and not particularly creamy; and the mussels were not as fresh as one would hope. The bread was its usual example of excellence. I wondered if some of the remaining menu items were more ""ready to serve"" offerings that can be stored, such as the short rib.  It had some interesting and enjoyable tastes but seemed a little dry for short rib as if it had been cooked hours prior, maybe even frozen and reheated for my meal - a suggestion that was strengthened by the fact a piece of tin foil was attached to the food.  The wine list has improved vastly over the 20 years we have been going to Duner's but don't expect to be served by anyone who knows much about the wine - even the pricier offerings.

My recent experience was the most disappointing 'Fine dining' experience I've ever had. To start, they have completely gutted the bold and broad menu. So many unique dishes have been removed that were a Duner's staple. We started with the fried oysters and they were fine, nothing spectacular but they were good. For my entree we had the halibut and the duck. The Halibut was so dry it was crumbling, the polenta did not taste fresh nor had much flavoring. The duck ($40) and compliments were a complete disappointment. The duck tasted boiled and to top it off it was smothered in a strawberry topping that tasted like jarred smuckers jam. The potatoes were boiled and un-seasoned. To end on a good note our server was fantastic, and has served me before.

The staff were lovely and very attentive which is why we are giving two stars. Our meal took an hour apparently due to my pork chop needing time to cook. If we had had an appetizer we wouldn't have minded, but again, the selection wasn't appealing. My husband had a steak. Both my pork chop and his steak were exceedingly tough and his steak was full of gristle. My broccoli and his asparagus were cooked to death. The mashed potatoes were just so-so. Dessert was ok, but again, nothing lived up the legend that this establishment has. Also, the noise level was so loud that my husband and I could not hear one another speak and we were seated at a small table for two. It was such a disappointment after all that we have heard that there is no reason for a return visit.",1.0,Duners

I especially loved dipping the crab cakes and fries in the tartar sauce. Fried crab cakes were good, but I think they would have been better baked or steamed.

Service was fast and friendly. It was a full house on a Wednesday night, so I highly recommend making reservations. Décor here is pretty basic, but great service and food quality.

The right ones are amazing and I have still encountered some that are just okay from the last couple of times I went. I definitely still avoid the chorizo ones because I did have one that had some chorizo in it and I felt the same about those as I did the first time.

Anyways, the moment I realize that they have great tacos is when I went at breakfast. And had their tacos with GARLIC MASHED POTATOES in them. That honestly makes everything so great. Coupled with eggs and queso fresco among other ingredients, you really can't go wrong. Highly recommend any of the tacos with the mashed potatoes in them. My absolute favorite taco so far has got to be the one of the vegetarian ones. Sweet potatoes, mushrooms, and those delicious mashed potatoes all in one? Incredible.

I've been to Brazos multiple times with friends, and I have always had a great experience. It is located right next to the IX Art Park, so the environment is enjoyable from the moment you pull into the parking lot.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating and fast service (even when there is a long line, they typically move quickly through the orders).

My favorite item on the menu is the Pork Star! It comes with a thick slice of pork belly, fresh avocado, sweet white onion, and cilantro. It has a great balance of flavors and textures, and it's a filling portion size. Typically a good portion is an order of about 3 tacos, and I always make sure the Pork Star is one of them!

Another favorite is a special that I always get when it's available. The steak, chimichurri, and mashed potato taco is delicious and filling. I've never had a taco quite like it, as it seems like a small serving of an entree from a high-end restaurant, resting on a fluffy tortilla.

Brazos is your typical taco stand, with a decent selection of different toppings and combibstions, each with their own merits. 

I thought the texture of the tacos weren't great for the meat tacos. It felt really empty, the tortilla was much drier than the ingredients inside, and overall it didn't feel accessible to the mouth. Carne asada was also a big disappointment, which was a bummer.

The pork belly was nice, although the accompanying parts didn't do much to help.

These tacos will have you drooling for more. Two to three of these wonders will content your ravenous stomach. They are amazingly fast at making the tacos. Shady Grady is one you have to try. Or any of the ones with mash potatoes. I was skeptical, but they are delicious.

For the indecisive ones:
There is a taco randomizer machine (Taco-bot) to help you with that. You can do give preferences or for the bold daredevils out there, you can do the random button. Makes it more enjoyable especially if you can't decipher from all the goodies.

The beer selection is pretty good, and also reasonably priced. The happy hours specials seem great, although I haven't had the chance to utilize them. There is ample parking, oh and in good weather they encourage dogs to hang out on the picnic benches outside. 

Triple pickle and many of their breakfast tacos are yummy! Their salsa bar reminds me of the places I used to go while living in San Diego (and their salsas taste good too!).

The only complaints I have are:
1. Their margaritas are super sweet, too sweet for me which is a problem when I want to have more than one.
2. The meat in the tacos is usually a bit overcooked (fish especially).",37.0,Brazos

I won't lie and call myself a taco expert (or deep lover) but I will say I enjoyed Brazos a lot. Got in right before the Saturday dinner rush and ordered three tacos. I ended up getting one breakfast taco and two other tacos. I wish I could remember the names of what I got but unfortunately I can't :( Needless to say each taco was delicious! I ended up liking the flour taco more so than the corn , since I found it to be a bit dry. I will say that in general I thought the tacos were just a bit too dry for me, but I'm no expert. 

The atmosphere itself is excellent, and the outdoor seating is so cute! Service was great, and pretty quick for how packed it ended up getting.

I might have ordered another taco or two but they were already closed and that would have put my bill for food over 20 dollars. I had to go to Three Notch'd and get some sliders.

My wife and I are both Texas natives and Brazos is (proudly) deliberately striving to emulate Texan taquerias such as Torchys, Fuzzys, etc. Like most Texas taco joints, you go in and order at the front and take a number to your table.  They offer three sauces (red, green, and avocado) to top your tacos. While ordering you have a huge menu above your head to help you decide which tacos to get. We ordered the chip salsa, queso, and guacamole sampler (the whole shebang). For tacos I got the Austin Morning egg taco and the black bean and egg El Guapo taco. Both tacos were excellent and definitely reminded me of home. The Austin morning was the better taco of the two. My wife also got the El guapo and the tres queso. 

Some additional thoughts, the food comes out super fast. Our tacos came out before our chips but the chips came out only a few minutes later. The chip app. The portion size of the chips is massive. Way bigger than needed for two people. Would easily feed three. The salsa, queso and guacamole are mostly fine but won't blow anyone away. The queso was a little plain. One other minor gripe (via my wife), is the soda machine was completely out of diet drinks and the guy at front didn't tell her that when she ordered it. 

They also offer alcoholic beverages which is nice if you are in the mood or want to chill on their nice covered patio. Ultimately, I would def recommend Brazos tacos for anyone with that itch for a solid, filling taco.",526.0,Brazos

The line can be long unless you time your meal during a UVA home game (because most people will be there instead of eating these delicious tacos). There are two registers and the employees go as fast as they can but when it's peak dinner or lunch time the lines can be long. But while you wait you can either look at their chalkboard menu on the wall or use a paper copy that they keep toward the front.

There are MANY options and during the week they do run specials like happy hour or half off during certain times of day. No matter what you choose you will enjoy. I know I always do.

Parking is plentiful and free, and it's not any harder to get to than anyplace else in Charlottesville, where I think Thomas Jefferson laid out the streets by following a one-eyed cow as it wandered up and down the hills.
I got the coffee, which was quite good. Despite the fact that the menu lists both hot and iced teas, when my Darling Bride ordered hot tea, she was informed that they never have that, they never HAVE had that, and the cashier has no idea why it's even on the sign. So she had water.
I got three tacos- the Shady Grady, which has brisket and sweet potato inside, the pork carnitas, and the Tres Quesos, which is a vegetarian taco. Don't judge. All were excellent, but the best part was the pickled watermelon in the Tres Quesos.
Darling Bride got the Shady Grady, too, as well as The Solid (brisket and mashed potatoes), and a third one which I forgot to ask about because we were all so busy talking and eating. Cousin got a couple of tacos for herself and also an order of chips, salsa, and guacamole for the table. The salsa was a little thin but quite tasty, and these people really know their way around an avocado!
It was way too noisy to sit inside and actually converse, so we sat outside, where my Darling Bride nearly froze to death; a tragedy that might have been prevented if only she'd had a cup of hot tea to warm her...

Zero service. Take out only. Clean your own table outside. No bathroom use.  You get the idea.   The only problem is that the Yelp reviews didn't reflect that so I need to leave this one because we chose Brazos based on Yelp. 

My husband and I stopped here on a road trip with our dogs.  We were looking forward to a nice lunch outside with table service and a bathroom.

  3.  No bathroom use

The Migas Taco is egg filled with tomatoes, onions, peppers, tortilla chips, and jack cheese. Both are served on tortilla of your choice.

My favorite go-to tacos are the Triple Pickle, Nacho Taco, and Sir Paul. The Triple Pickle is refried black beans, mushroom bruja, roasted pepitas, jalapeños, red onion pickles, jalapeño pickles, and pickled watermelon with lime. Trust me, I know its sounds weird, but IT IS SO GOOD! The Nacho Taco is more basic with beans, pickled jalapeños, onions, tomatoes, corn chips, and house queso. The Sir Paul is a simpler creation that's made with refried black beans, avocado, roasted corn pico, and roasted pepitas. 

Honorable mentions go to the This Is My Yam and Tres Quesos. This Is My Yam is a must try with its crisped sweet potatoes, refried black beans, sliced avocado, queso fresco, and roasted pepitas. Finally the Tres Quesos is a classic with its oaxacan cheese, manchego cheese, queso fresco, refried black beans, sliced avocado, roasted corn pico, and pickled watermelon. 

I'm super pumped to get Brazos again the next time I'm in Charlottesville! 

P.S. The tacos are on the pricier side and you definitely need 3-4 for it to be filling, but they're so worth!",182.0,Brazos

We've had their tacos during our last few visits to Charlottesville; however it was our first time dining at Brazos during our most recent visit. It is right across from IX Art Park.

Location is great. Nice outdoor seating area. Service is pretty fast. 
Now the most important part is the food. Every single time I ate here the food was tasteless. The tacos are extra small. Barely any filling. The meats, doesn't matter which, are bland. 
To me it seems as a lack of passion or effort from either management or the kitchen. When you get your plate it doesn't bring any excitement, after the first bite you realize you were served disappointment. 
Hopefully they can come up with better recipes, good tasting meat and put some effort into what they serve.

I can imagine intentionally visiting Brazos Tacos on a Taco Tuesday to eat multiple Tacos at a lower price (if an actuality).

Asada is great at 2nd, awful at Emmet. The picadillo is awful at 2nd, great at Emmet. Queso can be great at both, but can also be pretty bad.

2023-12-07 00:00:00,4.0,"Our first visit to this restaurant -- for a late lunch on a Wednesday in Dec around 2 pm.  We were greeted and seated quickly by the hostess.  The restaurant was quiet, with patrons at only two or three other tables.  We noticed that they also had a nice fenced-in outdoor seating area but it was closed given the cold temperatures. 

Most of the menu was Mexican street-style tacos with interesting choices for fillings, served on your choice of a small (6""? diameter) tortilla (corn, flour, or in a cup).  The menu suggested ordering 3 tacos if you're hungry; the waitress said many choose two tacos for lunch or three for dinner. 

We each ordered two tacos.  My husband preferred his choice from the vegetarian menu -- This Is My Yam ($4.00, his rating 5/5). This featured crisped yams with black beans, avocado, queso fresco, and roasted pepitas.  He also got a Carnitas taco ($4.25, 3/5), with slow-roasted pork shoulder, avocado, pickled red onion, cilantro, and lime.  He would've preferred shredded pork to the chunks served in the taco, and less pickled red onion.  My preferred taco was my Guisada ($4.75, rating 4/5), which featured slow-roasted brisket, diced onion, pickled jalapeño, and queso fresco. My second choice was the vegan The Woody ($4.20, 3/5), which had black beans, mushrooms in salsa bruja, roasted corn pico, and avocado. While I like all of the individual ingredients, it seemed to be missing something when put together. 

The restaurant also offered four salsas (two spicy) at a do-it-yourself counter. We took samples of all, but the tacos were flavorful enough without the added sauces. We would've liked if the tacos were served with an included side dish -- though a few options were offered on the menu, such as escabeche ($5), slaw ($4), or wood-grilled broccolini ($7).  The restaurant also offers some interesting drinks including aqua frescas and margaritas that we didn't try, this time. 

One final note.  Our waitress decided to sweep the floor under the tables near where we were sitting while we were still eating.  This really killed the ambiance of the restaurant for us not to mention our concerns about sanitation. (0/5)!",450.0,Brazos

First basket of chips+salsa is free. Additional baskets are $1. Makes me question why....  nothing special going on here.

I had the Fajitas de Carnitas. Most popular dish out of everyone's (8). I drool when I think of those flavorful, pull-apart chunks of carnitas that come out sizzling hot and tasty. Possibly the best carnitas I've ever had (certainly better than Chipotle! hahaha). Still not so sure about the rest of the overly large menu though...

Half priced jumbo margaritas all day on Sundays and Tuesdays! Available frozen or regular. So delicious. (I downed two of these myself)",497.0,Guad

2012-03-10 00:00:00,2.0,"OVERALL 2/5 This place is a bottom basement Mexican place which provides cheap, but relatively tasteless food and plenty of alcohol. Come here if you are looking for plenty of margaritas and something to shovel into your mouth along with them, otherwise look elsewhere.

FOOD 2/5
Not really even average, the food here tastes as cheap and quick as it is made. The low quality ingredients and mish-mash of premade items reminds me of a grade school cafeteria. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, it just doesn't really taste good. About one step up from a frozen Mexican TV dinner. 

DRINK 3/5
The restaurant shines in its ability to provide cheap alcohol. Not the greatest margaritas in the world by a long shot, but you can get a lot of them and have a good time.

AMBIENCE 3/5
There are a couple locations in Charlottesville, this one isn't the greatest but it isn't bad. About a dozen tables with nice warm colored walls. The big sell here is the limited amount of outdoor seating which makes this a very nice place in warmer weather.

SERVICE 3/5

I've been here in pre-COVID times for food and margaritas before going to a UVA football game with a group of friends (recommend for a fun activity once we return to a sense of normalcy), but found the food very average at the time. After ordering delivery recently, however, I was much happier with the food we got and want to give them a shout out during these hard times of food delivery!

We got the nachos texanos which was reminiscent of Tex-Mex vibes with its grilled fajita style chicken, steak, and shrimp topped with onions and bell pepper. The shrimp and steak were super tasty, but was a little masked by the liquid cheese sauce (bias note: I prefer melted shredded cheese on nachos). It felt pricey at $18, but the portion was huge!! Enough to share between 2 people and have some leftovers. I also appreciated that they gave us extra chips on the side so it wouldn't get too soggy!

The floors are another issue--not only sticky but also slippery like they haven't been properly cleaned in a while.

Overall, it's the service that has been so terrible. Waiting forever to place an order, to receive the bill, and even just to get basic attention from staff has become the norm. Yesterday, when I arrived to pick up a takeout order, two staff members walked right by me without making eye contact or asking if I needed assistance.

Great portion size in my opinion. 

One negative was that the fryer was broken so we couldn't have any fried tofu or spring rolls or anything. Hopefully this was just a fluke and they get it fixed soon. I didn't knock them down a star for it because sometimes unforseeable things happen.

The fried rice was not bad, it was very bland. Gordon Ramsey would say that chef mike made it, you know.. the microwave.

I don't actually think they microwave their food, just that the fried rice was bland.

Next time I got a tofu and veggie sautee, which was delicious, yet quite a small portion for $10.

It was a one man show: he took our order, delivered our wine, took care of to go orders, and answered phones. We got the soft shell, duck, and pork belly with noodles. My favorite was the duck, which was a huge portion! Not very spicy, though, with the 2 star warning... everyone else's fave was the pork dish- so tender! The soft shell crab was actually disappointing. We normally love soft shell, but this one had no flavor despite bathing in sauce. Also, because of the safety precautions, our food was served in Tupperware and we ate with plastic cutlery. This made it slightly difficult to eat because the plastic knife and fork would just flex and bend instead of cutting! Oh, and lucky us! $15 off bottles of wine..we got 2!",437.0,Monsoon

2020-11-15,4.0,"If you like Thai food and want to walk around the Charlottesville Mall before/after dinner, I would highly recommend this place! Only one block from the mall and very good Thai food. 

Parking: street parking, can be a little challenging. We parallel parked a block away. 

Vibe: outdoor seating with a cute date night vibe. Pretty heat lamps. Perfect for a night out. 

Food: I got the massaman curry and it was very good. The chicken was super tender and the flavor of the curry was amazing. Only suggestion-have them chop up the peanuts and sprinkle on top instead of leaving them whole. My husbands Pad Thai was good too but we agreed the curry was better. We had the mango sticky rice for desert and that was on par for the best mango sticky rice I have had. 

Wait time: We sat down at 6 and it wasn't very crowded, however, by 7, every outdoor table was taken! Unfortunately our food took 30-40 minutes to come out since they were packed and it seems like they get a ton of takeout orders that they have to prepare. It was odd because the people next to us put their order in after ours and got their food a solid 20 min before us. Maybe it depends on what you order or they forgot to put our order in- who knows. 

Staff: Very friendly and checked in enough. Were doing the best they could with how slammed they were! 

Price: Very reasonable! Meals are around $11-$15.

Service here was solid despite the busyness that comes with evening hours.

Pad Thai can be slimy in some places or too dry in others, but here it met right in the middle. Most, if not all, Pad Thai dishes come with a small pile of grounded peanuts next to the noodles. I usually expect to taste some sort of a subtle nutty flavor, but the pad Thai here had a much richer nutty flavor in its noodles. Unexpectedly really good, flavor wasn't too overwhelming.

Monsoon Siam is an incredible outside, nighttime eatery. The lights and ambience of the city of Charlottesville heighten the experience to a level some better Thai places will never accomplish.

When my sister and I were seated, we placed our orders quickly. I ordered an appetizer of a coconut milk soup (Tom Ka?) and pad thai. My sister ordered chicken fried rice. We ended up waiting nearly 25 minutes for my soup to come out. During that time, no one came to the table. Was the soup made to order? Anyways, the soup was thankfully delicious and the best part of the meal. There was so much soup in this bowl!

The main courses came out 10 minutes later. I love pad thai, so I always have high expectations. This pad thai was good. Just good. I would say the same about the fried rice.

2023-02-21,4.0,Monsoon Siam is pretty good thai food for Charlottesville and one of the few places I know of to go. They have a great menu offering but some of the dishes are hit or miss. I really like their thai tea!!!,246.0,Monsoon
2023-02-27,2.0,"Monsoon Siam is a pretty small restaurant that doesn't have much seating or its own parking lot.

I'd heard really good things about the food here and came with a group of friends. Sadly, the experience that I had here was firmly below mid. The food took 30+ minutes to come out, and it wasn't that they forgot about us - people around us were also not getting their food either. This place is either understaffed or the logistics need some work. 

With regards to the food itself, it was good but not great. My duck noodles came in a sauce that was supposed to be a little spicy (it wasn't). The duck itself was seasoned well and quite tasty, but the noodles were okay. We were all very hungry by the time we got our food, which probably made the food taste better than it was.

When we got our bill, we realized that they had built in a mandatory 20% tip, which is particularly annoying as we had received such bad service. 

This place would be quite good if the service was remotely functional",305.0,Monsoon

The food and drinks were both great. I had a Thai mule, which is not the type of cocktail I typically go for, but it came in the cutest mug and I had to try it. It was delicious, perfectly sweet with interesting flavors. I would love to try their whole cocktail menu! I got the Pad Thai (beef) as a meal, and it was some of the best I've had. Their Pad Thai sauce was almost creamy. and coated the noodles perfectly. Hitting it with just a little lime was perfect, and the portion was so large it ended up being two meals for me!

The curry was fantastic and extremely flavorful. We had the duck curry this time we went, but I think my favorite is the green curry. I could drink it as-is from the bowl! The Cigar Puffs were ok; I liked the peppery filling but the crust was too thick and greasy. The drunken noodles were also pretty good, but nothing to write home about.

They will also adjust the spice level to your preference which I always appreciate as someone who unfortunately cannot handle the heat as much as I try. The duck was a little dry but had good flavor overall. I've also had their pad thai which is good and on-par with most other Thai restaurants in the area.

We sat at the patio, and it was all our first time there. I can see how it can get chilly and they don't have patio heaters. We were seated fairly quickly aside from being a busy Friday night, and were given waters and a carafe with water. The server came to get our orders, and we got appetizers and entrees. Appetizers came out blazing fast! But, the entrees, took almost an hour. When we asked about it, they said it was because a large party came right before we arrived. We then instantly regretted not asking to have our entrees out with our appetizers since we were starving from a long hike... we also asked her for recommendations, and they were decent, generic ones (I think. She said panang curry, drunken noodles... the most ordered dishes in any Thai place). I got khao soi (with soft shell crab). It was probably the best dish on their menu.

If you want Basil Fried Rice you're gonna have to jump through some hoops and slam some dunks! The basil fried rice was actually delicious and they gave me enough to have some for lunch the next day. The building was small. Not a lot of room for a breakdance battle, but I don't mind at all because it was beautiful and it let me be even closer to my co-reviewer Charlotte! This location reminded me of going on a safari, but that was mostly due to walking through the bush and the one hundred degree heat that consumed my flesh outside!

2024-09-14,5.0,"Great authentic Thai food in the middle of unlikely place - Charlottesville! I was visiting C-ville with my extended family just for half a day and I chose this place over so many good lunch options, and Monsoon Siam delivered like ... a monsoon rain of flavors! (See what I did there?) 
First, it's a bit off the Main Street so you might be tempted to not go there... but Main Street means more price for not always better quality... so check one box. And it did not disappoint my large group of family - almost every dish we ordered was tasty in that authentic Thai way and service was also prompt. 
We had kids from toddler to teen ages and they all went silent eating, and all the adults were sharing and enjoying. 
Just to highlight a few, my Hai Yat noodle was absolutely delicious... perfect chewy noodles in savory sauce with tons of fresh delicious seafood. Other winners were pad kee mao (drunken noodle), pad Thai, and crab fried rice.
One minor mistake was when we didn't get the Kao Soi noodle dish because there was misunderstanding and they brought another dish instead which was gingery... but even that, we finished it all so wasn't a big deal. Their Thai iced tea was a tad bit too sweet though. 
Everybody left with a fully belly and we even took a group pic to commemorate our lunch.

2025-01-02,5.0,"My best friend and I were ranking cuisines after we ate here and we both agreed that Thai was probably in top 5 -- not sure if Monsoon Siam ended up skewing it because honestly it was that good. We got the hat yay noodle, crispy pork noodle, and fresh rolls.

The peanut sauce that goes with the fresh rolls is borderline drinkable and honestly good enough of a reason to order it to begin with. I absolutely love how crunchy and fresh the vegetables are and it's so well-balanced with the creaminess of the avocado.

The crispy texture of the coating on the pork paired really well with the softness of the noodles, and the presentation was immaculate, although the meat tasted a little bit gamey. 

But I think the real star of the show was the hat yay noodles. It was so sweet and savory at the same time, perfectly saucy, and the chewy noodles provided such a great comparison to the crunchy veggies and the outer fried rice paper! The seafood was also a really nice touch.

The interior is super duper cute and I would love to come back on a day trip to try out more of the dishes they have.",136.0,Monsoon

The menu was explained as small plates but most definitely NOT tapas because they were served as they came out from the kitchen and not all at once. This concept was definitely lost on me since I'm pretty sure that is exactly what tapas is...but I digress....

Everything on the menu looked absolutely fantastic so whittling down our choices was quite hard. We decided to go with (almost) ALL of the things!

Roasted beets with ricotta cheese - Nature has never tasted this good before
Roasted brussel sprouts - I'm a huge fan of brussel sprouts but I thought this was okay. The sprouts should have been roasted a bit longer to caramelize and get tender and this strongly tasted of fish sauce without any other flavor.
Scallop Crudo - A generous portion of the most tender, sweet scallops I have ever tasted. It took every bit of will in my body not to snatch all of these at once.
Grilled octopus open faced sando - The garbanzo puree on the toast was simple and delicious. I'm definitely going to be incorporating this into my sandwiches at home. That being said, the octupus was overcooked and rubbery and tasted like char. 
S'mores Bread Pudding - The most inventive bread pudding I've ever seen. I loved how all the slices tasted like brownie ends and the bruleed marshmallow was just perfection.",2041.0,Oakhart

TL;DR: order the shaved salad, wood fired oysters, sweet sticky pork belly and pork shank. Could get better food else where for the price but the atmosphere and customer service made this place worthwhile. Not sure I would ever come back here though.

For those beer & wine lovers: there's an extensive menu and seasonal specials. 

We ordered the following:

Shaved salad: It always seems a little silly to me to go out and order a salad, but you can't go wrong with this salad! There's so much flavor to this salad and the combination of items was brilliant. There was a lot of dressing on the salad and I absolutely hate salad dressing but everything for this dish worked. Highly recommend this item!

Wood fired oysters: Definitely do not like oysters because of the taste and texture. But Oakhart made this work in every single way! The flavor was light and not very ""oyster"" like and there was a brilliant crunch from the crumb. This order comes with four oysters, so make sure you order according to your party size. 

Oyster Mushrooms: Mehhh. There wasn't anything particularly special about the flavor of this item for me.

Provoletta: If I did my visit over, I would definitely pass on this item. The bread for the make your own ""pizza"" is a bit too wood fired cooked for me. In addition, the bread had a lot of holes when it was baked, so there wasn't a lot of a bread filling. The provolone and goat cheese combination wasn't my favorite. 

Chicken wangz: Would not really recommend this item. The cream sauce was the same one served with the shaved salad but it did not go well with the wings to me.

Sweet & Sticky pork belly: Solid order but this wasn't the best pork belly I've ever had or something that really stands out to me. Definitely a good amount of flavor and would recommend but is not something special.

Chili lime roast shrimp pizza: My friends and I agree that this pizza tastes like any regular pizza but the difference for Oakhart social is how well the pizza was cooked. You can taste the smokiness of the pizza and the crust was fluffy yet soft. The texture and consistency were good but the flavors of the pizza was just whatever. 

Pork Shank Special: The pork fell off nicely and was cooked super well. It was delicious but I was kind of confused with the pairing of items. The pork shank was served on a pile of some sort of grains that I can't recall what it was?  There was also a yogurt cilantro to pair with the pork and I wished they stopped there. The combination of the Indian taste like grains and American meat was odd but would have been yummier without the grains. Still a solid order though!

Overall: The rustic atmosphere of brick wall, dimly lit light and excellent service made dinner very pleasant! Unfortunately, I'm not sure Oakhart Social is a place I would come to again but it was definitely a fun experience. My biggest beef with this place is probably the pairing of items - the combination just didn't work for me. There's an outside eating area that would be nice for when the weather is warmer.",56.0,Oakhart
2017-02-10 00:00:00,4.0,"My friend and I came here for dinner and ordered the Brussels Sprouts (with Korean chilli, aioli, and crispy shallots) and the Marinated Mushrooms & Black Kale Pizza (with garlic potato cream and parmesan). 

The pizza was one of the best I've ever had! The garlic potato cream was an amazing touch. The brussels sprouts were a little disappointing though, as they were very salty. I've seen other great reviews for the brussels sprouts so I think it was just an off-night for them, but I'd recommend ordering the aioli on the side just in case. The crispy shallots on top almost made up for the saltiness though.

Service was good and they have a private parking lot right next to it! That was a major plus for me, especially since it's so hard to find street parking in the West Main area.

Also, the menu they have on their website is not completely accurate. There were a few dishes that didn't appear on the menu in the actual restaurant, but there were still plenty of delicious options.",619.0,Oakhart
2017-03-05 00:00:00,5.0,"Dang, I like this place. 

Built out of an old three stall auto shop, this restaurant/bar doesn't try to hide it's history. I believe the original renovation was completed by a restaurant that failed. Oakhart took over and while I'm not sure on what they changed, the end results are great. The two stalls on the left still have their garage doors, but replaced with French doors connecting their dining patio. The patio makes the best of its space and stretches across all three stalls. It is lit with overhead hung oversized bulb lighting, which gives it a nice ambiance. The bar takes the space of the stall on the far right. About ten seats at the L shaped bar.

I've sat at the bar every time I've been here and it has suited me just fine. They do encourage drinking here, so if that's on your list, you'll fit right in. They have quite a large wine selection. I just tried to ignore that page of the menu!

I heard so many good things about this establishment and have driven by several times telling myself that I needed to try the place out. The place looks so promising with their cute decor and natural lighting, but it just didn't deliver to the hype. 

I tried the mushroom grits, octopus oyster mushroom pizza, and the margherita pizza. The mushroom grits were...interesting. The grits were actually quite tasty and creamy; however the mushroom was kind of weird. It was larger, tart, and had a bitter char on it. I wasn't the biggest fan. It came with garbanzo beans that were yummy, but the whole dish had this interesting Indian flavor. For 13 dollars tho, I really don't think it was worth it. Our server recommended the octopus mushroom pizza and since it sounded different we decided to go for it. The pizza had  a good thin crust, but it was actually quite burnt so there was a slight bitter taste in each bite. Ironically, it got soggy quickly even though it was burnt. Thank god for the margherita pizza. It honestly saved the meal. It was actually so delicious and was a decent size. The basil on it was so fresh and everything was perfect. 

The biggest disappointment about this place was how everything was served ONE AT A TIME. I get it but man they really could not work with us because we were starving. They waited for us to finish each plate before presenting us with the next one. The problem was we didn't intend on sharing our plates like a tapas style meal so it was pretty annoying. I really don't think I would come back...idk maybe for drinks. Overall, I wouldn't give this place more than 3 stars just because it was pricey, the food wasn't that great, and the portions were wayyy too small.",196.0,Oakhart

First off, I loved the interior design and ambiance. The lighting is warm and cozy and the tables are well arranged to maximize numbers yet provide enough intimacy. The bar is not big but there's a little ""socializing area"" between the dining area and the bar where people gather and chat. I thought that was a cute design! The restaurant does get a little loud so sometimes it can get hard to hold a conversation. 

For the meal, they started us off with complimentary champagne- a nice surprise for the night. The plates are meant to be shared so they serve the dishes as soon as they come out. My boyfriend and I got the shaved salad, the hanger steak, and the ribs. 

The shaved salad was beyond amazing. I don't even know all the different vegetables and fruits they put in there, but the combination was magical. The crumbs on the top combined with the sauce give the salad such a nice crunch as well as a rich, tangy taste. Most highly recommend! 

My next favorite dish was the onion ring and ribs. The BBQ sauce and aioli sauce were so delicious! The ribs were well smoked and very meaty. The portion size was also quite large, definitely enough for two. 

The hanger steak was good, too, but did not quite match up to my expectations. It was definitely too well done and too tough for a ""medium,"" and it took a long time before we got it. The potatoes that accompanied the dish were fabulous though- crispy and well-seasoned!

2018-03-16 00:00:00,4.0,"This place is very good! The best way to do it is to go with a group and share so you can sample lots of different dishes. My favorite items thus far have been the shaved salad, ricotta toast, squash tortellini, and bread pudding. I am generally anti-salad so the fact that the shaved salad made it into my top dishes list shows just how good it is. 

A lot of people love the brussels sprouts here too but both times I've had them they were a bit undercooked. The catfish was prepared well but wasn't ""Nashville Hot"" as advertised. 

Overall, the quality of food here is quite high. The main reason I don't want to give 5 stars is because their cocktail menu is lacking-- it's all gins and whiskeys. I don't know why it is so hard to find good tequila cocktails in Cville! They also make you put in a credit card if you are reserving a table online, which is kind of a bummer.

2018-04-27 00:00:00,4.0,"I learned a few things from my recent experience at Oakhart Social. The biggest take-a-way I got was that this place offers a tapas style dining experience and if you aren't going to eat your meal tapas style, you probably won't enjoy it. I ate at this restaurant a while ago and everyone at my table got their own entree (no sharing at all) so we all did not have a great experience. However, when I came here recently and had a tapas style meal, it was an amazing experience! 

The server recommended everyone at the table getting 2-3 dishes to share. Sharing was a great way to try all the small dishes at this restaurant. Here are a few items we got:
-Shaved Salad: This sounded just like an ordinary salad but it was so good. Definitely one of the best salads I've ever had. Get this! 
-Wood Fire Oysters: I loved the citrus gremolata on the oysters. Also, the bacon fat really tied this dish together. 
-Roasted Beets: I'm not a big fan of beets so this dish wasn't that great for me. The beets tasted pretty bland- just boiled beets basically.
-Pate: Surprisingly, the pate was really good on the toasted, crunchy bread that it came with. I usually don't eat or like pate but it was pretty good.
-Grilled Octopus: I really liked the octopus! It had a charred flavor and the texture was nice.
-Chicken Wangz: GET THIS. I loved this dish. The chicken wings are so savory, crunchy, and just perfect. 
-Hanger Steak: The steak was super tender and flavorful. I loved the fried potatoes that came with this dish. 
-Fried Catfish: This was also one of my favorites of the meal. The catfish was moist and the breading was so crunchy. 
-Five Cheese Garlic Pizza: Very creamy and really crispy! 
-Pot de Creme: A solid dessert. The creme was smooth and indulgent. 

Overall, my dining experience was memorable. I'd highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a unique dining opportunity. If you despise tapas stye, don't come here.",222.0,Oakhart

The crispy lamb shank is probably the best dish of the restaurant, with the meat cooked perfectly well -- super juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I think the process of cooking the dish takes a while, so they limit to ordering it until 9:30 PM.

Eloquent Bastard: this smelled like soap or some kind of detergent. I had to hold my breath to drink it and it was far from good. Half of the drink was foam. 

Pineapple 22A: this tasted like straight liquor mixed with burnt pineapple juice. 


For food we got:

Beets: This was nothing special. It tasted like beets from a can. 

Squash: This was the best part of our meal and that's saying a lot. Again, nothing special. 

Octopus: Half of the octopus was burnt and completely inedible. 

Swordfish: This tasted like something you would get from the frozen aisle of the grocery store. The fish had no flavor and it was very dry. The accompanying sauce tasted like a cheap honey mustard. The garnish was pieces of bitter lettuce.

My wife and I are farmers and don't get out much. But somehow, the three or four times we've come here, a new and impeccably-dressed gay man has complimented my wife's outfit. I'd been previously unaware that the fashion opinions of said men carry enough weight with cishet women to inhale the light of a collapsing star, but damned if I didn't learn something new that first time. 

She was a happy lady after leaving Oakhart Social. We didn't have any children the first time we went, and now we have two. I'll leave it to your imagination/nightmares to put two and two together.

Even if all the above didn't happen, the food is still worth five stars. I never had anything here I didn't want a whole lot more of. The pizza crusts are so good, they're worth stealing out of the kitchen*. My dad - a septuagenarian who sometimes pretends to forget my name just to mess with me - never fails to recall exactly how good Oakhart's lamb shank was, and then immediately thereafter yell at me for being a livestock farmer that does not raise sheep, which is true, for the following reason:

Cousin: ""You uh... you ever gon' raise sheep?""

Me: ""We probably will. Just not yet.""

Cousin: ""Mmmhmm. When you get em... you gon' $%@! em?""

The food is meant to be shared.

Started with the shaved salad.  This vegetarian option was fresh and light.  The dressing was a perfect match to the vegetables.

Next up were the charred carrots which were charred to perfection - is that possible?  

Moving on to the artic char.  The braised cabbage made for an interesting dish.  Really liked this one.

The place is small plates-ish style - so you can def order to share.  If you only order one thing ORDER THE RICOTTA TOAST.  It is DELIGHTFUL!  The bread is that thick cut bougie fresh toast with that oh so creamy goodness of ricotta lathered on top.  It's then served with peas on top and a light and amazing vinaigrette. YES. It's a win. You won't regret it. I promise.

The other dish that stood out to me as well was the mushroom pizza.  Amazing cheesy goodness!   Plus, got to love the fungi!  The pork steak is also quite an impressive plate - so not for the faint of heart.  Ok, but not-so-faves, stood the scallion pancake and the wood-fired oysters... 
If you come by during happy hour, there are a few food specials and the fired mushrooms are also quite delicious.

The beverages are also good to the last drop - carefully crafted they are so well thought out and truly different.  I was a big fan of the perfect perfect manhattan as well as the mezcal pineapple beauty that was recipe number 22A version of the cocktail.

The shaved salad received high praise online and I knew I had to have it. I love salads, and this didn't let me down. Peeled carrots and thin slices of apple and breadcrumbs(!!!) coming together with lightly dressed arugula was so texturally impressive, not to mention how well the flavors worked. I could eat the salad as a whole meal. The slivers of date brought such brightness. I kept trying to construct the ""perfect bite"" of salad with all the components, but every combination is its own treat.

I savored every bit of the tuna crudo. For me, the jalapeno was too much and overwhelmed my palate, so I only tried it with one piece. The citrusy sauce was so, so good, I was trying to sop up a good amount with every morsel of tuna. I want more.

Ramp is all the rage, so I chose the pappardelle dish over the xo carbonara which had also caught my eye. Again, a feat of flavors. Each noodle was perfectly coated in butter, and the pickled ramp were little bursts of joy. The oyster mushrooms were cooked to have nice deep flavor, and again, the textural variety was excellent, I loved the bits of walnut.

I enjoyed how they brought each dish out individually so you had time to enjoy, and all dishes came with large utensils for east sharing. Our server was also very helpful and the kitchen was very accommodating for my dairy free needs and prepared everything deliciously. 
The scallion pancake was probably my favorite dish of the night, it was light and almost crepe like abs had picked cucumbers and a delicious sauce on top  which were both unique and balanced. The snapper was amazing with perfectly crispy skin and had a very tasty tomato type sauce underneath. The strawberry fry pie was great as well, even though it was fried it didn't taste heavy at all and the strawberries were very fresh.

The texture of their Little Gem salad was excellent and the flavors of the fresh greens and amazing, house-made dressing was incredible!

Hanger steak with chimichurri was perfectly cooked, with a light aioli that paired perfectly with the potatoes. Sausage pizza was amazing, good crunch to the crust and the sausage as fresh and tasty.

2022-12-17 00:00:00,4.0,"Given Oakhart Social's close proximity to UVA, I was pleasantly surprised by how the ambiance departed from the typical college town vibes. It evokes a city-like, hip atmosphere with quite some creative combination of flavors. To sample what the menu had to offer, we got a variety of dishes and shared together. 

Starting with the peach & shishito toast, we wished the toast was a bit crunchier to support the toppings. The pickled onions had a subdued flavor, which is something I prefer as it would overwhelm the milder sweetness of the peach. Although there was nothing glaringly wrong with this dish, it was the charred carrots appetizer that truly won us over. The crunchiness of the pecans paired nicely with the tenderness of the carrots. If carrots were to be overdone, the texture would be too soft. Yet this dish maintained the proper bite of a carrot while being tender. 

The fried chicken was a pleasant new rendition of a seemingly simplistic dish.  Containing a bit of Southeast Asian influence, the batter was crispy and maintained juiciness while the garnishes were an assortment of basil, mint, and cilantro. The lightness and freshness of the herbs provided a contrast to the fried chicken yet balanced in a remarkably appealing way. And while fish sauce is typically sharp and seemingly out of place with fried chicken, this rendition complemented surprisingly well. 

The trout was crispy and while the flavor profile wasn't awful, it lacked the spunk and impression that the other dishes provided. 

The desserts on the other hand fell flat and would recommend going somewhere else instead.",76.0,Oakhart
2023-01-28 00:00:00,5.0,"First of all I can't believe I found this place so late into my stay here in Charlottesville. Highly suggest reservations because this place was packed for a Friday night. They have an outdoor tent that's heated and it looked like blankets at the table. But the tent was def warmer than inside which is where we sat. I feel like this place is a hidden gem and hardly gets suggested when asking people of good places to eat. I'm throwing Oakhart into my top 3 suggestions. We ordered several dishes and drinks. The espresso martini was prob one of the best I've found here in Cville. The hibiscus Margarita also very tasty. As for food.... We started with the shaved salad which was amazing, however it seemed over salted not sure if it was added, or the garlic parm dressing or what. It was a great mix in flavors, nice hint apples and dates. Next was the ricotta toast which was probably my favorite dish. I've been obsessing over pepper jelly lately and that was the perfect ingredient to add to this toast. The flavors balanced out so well with the ham, the jelly, the cheese, and the pear. 10/10 recommend that fish. We had the wood fire oysters which I didn't think anything special about them but my bfs absolutely loved them. Our main entree dishes I had ordered the grilled pork steak which was a perfect mix with sweet, spicy and nutty. The pineapple with the steak, and the jalapeños just OMG mouth watering good. The five cheese pizza was nothing special, my bf ordered which advised against, which we would have gotten the sausage pizza instead. Lastly we ordered dessert. The s'more bread pudding was mind blowing. I could have ordered like 4 more of those. The service was absolutely amazing, spot on with delivery of each dish one by one without long waits in between. They cleared dishes rather quickly too which I like when places do that. I def am coming back here sooner than later. 10/10 highly recommend.

This place is great for any occasion, including spilling scandalous secrets with your girlfriends or going on a first date with that guy you met from Hinge(and if that doesn't go well, at least the ABC store is right across the street). 


 Of course the food was absolutely exquisite. We started with the charred carrots, which were nicely topped off with some micro greens, sprouts to be exact(8/10). Then, we got the Hanger Steak(100/10), decorated with fingerling potatoes and chimichurri on both sides. The steak was tender and the potatoes were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Also, the dish came with this gochujang aeoli that I was practically scraping off with my fork even after I finished the food. For our last dish, we got the sausage pizza(9/10). The tomato sauce was so rich and paired well with the thin crust. With room for desserts, we got the Pear Fry Pie(8.5/10) and S'mores Bread Pudding(9/10), which were also great.

On my most recent visit with friends, I tried the espresso martini. It was good and I thought it tasted like La Colombe Vanilla Latte mixed with vodka.

My favorites dishes here are the Hanger Steak, Charred Carrots, and most recently the Roasted Broccoli. The hanger steak here is my favorite hanger steak ever. I'm glad they brought it back on my visits this past year. The charred carrots and roasted broccoli are my favorite carrots and broccoli that I've ever had. They are consistently prepared well and cooked to perfection. These dishes are must orders when I visit. The fish sauce caramel, garlic aioli, and sesame crumble for texture on the broccoli are divine.

The only dishes I haven't liked in my time coming here are the Tuna Crudo and Cabbage Scallion Pancakes.

My wife and I always order plates to share, and the servings here were just the right size for that. The shaved salad with fennel, carrots, apples, and dates was extremely tasty. The beet salad with oranges and yogurt and something crunchy was delicious. The seared trout was tender and sweet, and accompanied by small potatoes in something like a cilantro-honey sauce. All of the dishes featured a variety of flavors and spices. They had a variety of craft beers, but my only complaint is that they were served in cans, not on draft. We highly recommend this place, and it deserves a much better rating than 4.3. Don't be put off by the negative reviews, they were mostly written by entitled people who think they deserved more attention. Maybe they did, but our service (from the bartender) was great. And even though the place was full, we didn't have to wait too long for any of the dishes.  Ratings on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (Excellent):  Food quality 5; Drinks 4; Service 5; Cleanliness 5; Ambience 5; Value 5;  Overall rating 5 stars!",15.0,Oakhart

2024-02-17 00:00:00,5.0,"My mother and I stopped in Charlottesville for a dinner at Oakhart Social on the way back from Virginia Beach trip. We arrived around 5:45-6pm on a Friday evening, without a reservation, and were told that there would be a wait, as it was starting to get busy. I would recommend a reservation because we waited about 30 minutes for an opening at the bar. The service was good, not great, but the staff were very friendly! The ambiance was rustic and the interior had an inviting feel about it. 

Their food is meant to be shared amongst the table and is portioned accordingly. We started with the shaved salad and beets. They were both unique dishes with nice combinations of flavors. The shaved salad had arugula, fennel, carrots, watermelon radish, fuji apples, medjool dates, crumb, and a garlic parmesan dressing. The shaved veggies were super crisp, the apples and dates added a slight sweetness, the crumbs gave it some texture, and the parmesan dressing tied all the flavors together. Overall it was a really unique, tasty slaw-like salad, would recommend! The beet dish included oranges, yogurt, pistachio, and tarragon. The beets were complimented by the oranges and the yogurt sauce gave it some tang. Next out pizzas arrived, and boy were they something! We tried the mushroom pizza first and were BLOWN away with it! The mushroom pizza has oyster and shiitake mushrooms, house-made ricotta, red sauce, and pistachio pesto. The pistachio pesto had immense flavor and paired magically with the creamy ricotta cheese. Next was the bacon pizza which had potato cream, bacon, kale, red onion, and lemon zest. This was definitely a different pizza, never had pizza with potato cream before. The potato cream had a richness to it, complimented by the smokiness of the bacon, and the slight citrus of the lemon. Overall both our pizzas were stellar and they weren't too heavy. We both agreed the  mushroom pizza was our favorite though. We ended the night with their s'mores bread pudding and certainly didn't regret it! We loved various elements of this dessert including the torched marshmallows and puppy chow. The bread pudding was a nice size and was warm when it arrived. 

All in all, we had a lovely experience here at Oakhart Social. The food was full of bold flavors, made with fresh, high quality ingredients. The service was decent, but could have been a little better. My mom ordered a coffee, which they forgot, so they took a drink off our bill. Everything we ordered we thoroughly enjoyed. The salad and beets were great starters and the pizzas were exceptional! Would recommend and will be retuning next time we are in Charlottesville.",116.0,Oakhart

After seeing how delicious the dinners of those around me looked, I went out on a limb and ordered a dish with spinach (I normally despise it) and I ended up polishing it off.

I went in the winter time so it was a bit cramped inside.  I can definitely see the potential for it in the warmer months though.

-1 star for the fact that our waitress broke the cork while opening our bottle of wine.  I know she was trying hard, but she still assured us that it was okay only to pour a glass, have cork in it, and not even notice.  To not be a jerk, I only asked for a replacement first glass, which she agreed to, but the one that she brought was clearly less full than the original one poured.

Note:  Though the restaurant name means peas...  I inquired and there seemed to be no secret pea recipe they had, so I didn't bother to try them.  My friend did and she thought they were good (but not mind blowing)

My girlfriend had the tuna entree, which was pretty bland, and honestly, not great at all. It was basically seared tuna on top of a salad with vinegar dressing. Portion was very small as well. I had the veal entree. The portion was small, again, but the meat was soft and went well with the creamy potatoes.

With my friend, I tried two appetizers, two entres, and a dessert.

To start, we had escargot and onion soup. The escargot was rich and garlicky from the standard herb butter treatment, but I found that the relative balance of butter versus herb and garlic was slightly off and would have liked to see more of the latter two. The onion soup was somewhat lighter than expected as it didn't have a rich flavor of beef stock as one typically hopes for, but they were really able to coax out a deep onion flavor that made up for it.

To continue, we had the beef short rib and the duck confit. Both came in generous portions. The beef short rib was enjoyable, and the crunchy potato was excellent--soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The only criticism I can muster is that the roasted carrots were a bit too sweet and the meat, while not dry, could have been slightly moister. The duck confit was a bit drier but still worked pretty well with the tart accompanying sauce.

To finish, we had the crme caramel (i.e. flan). The citrus and clove sauce was an excellent accompaniment and was well suited to the cold winter day on which we dined.",76.0,petitpois

We had a delicious round of appetizers including French Onion Soup and Mussels which were both outstanding.  Afterwards I begrudgingly picked out the steak frites - now, I love steak frites, but they're so often disappointing at places nowadays that I feel like it's a big gamble to order them.  Thank goodness Petit Pois proved me wrong.  I'm not exaggerating even a little when I say it was absolutely the best steak frites I have ever had.  The frites were crispy, full of herbs and flavor, and the steak perfectly done with a deliciously seared crust.  Could not have asked for better.  Went great with a local Lovingston white wine which I really enjoyed.

This place is minuscule inside so make sure you plan accordingly.  Also, the entire place is in the draft zone of the door, which is incredibly annoying. They really should put a curtain or something in place to mitigate the horrible icy breeze that sweeps through the place every time someone enters or exits.

She was so passionate and energetic and informative about everything on the menu - and so warm -- she really made our meal.

We started out with drinks - with Joellen introducing us to a kind of wine made for several thousand years in the country of Georgia. I wasn't sure if it was what I wanted with my meal, so Joellen brought a bit for me and my husband to try.  It was lovely and interesting but not what I wanted with my dinner. But...I wasn't sure what I wanted, so after I selected my meal (with some help from her -- providing details on various dishes), Joellen offered to provide a selection of suitable pairings. She brought two white wines which she also was knowledgeable about. I tasted them both and instantly selected one to go with my fish.

We  had the chicken liver pate appetizer - the chicken is from a local farm, as are many of their ingredients. It was a mix of amazing flavors and spices and came with these perfectly buttery, toasted bread crisps. The combination was amazing.

Then my husband had the lamb meatballs and  I had the trout almondine. We both loved our dishes. The combination of flavors and elements...just lovely.

It did have a nice herby sauce! It was served with half a plate of shoestring fries which were tasty. I wish there had been some homemade ketchup instead of a commercial brand. I tried my husband's risotto, and it was bland and definitely undercooked. It had a ton of gorgeous fresh vegetables, but it desperately needed more flavor.

My friend and I sat at the bar which wasn't too bad but definitely wouldn't have worked out if I had come with a larger party.

I also tried their chicken with mashed potatoes which was reallly good and the chicken was very well cooked and juicy on the inside. I also had some dessert but I forgot what I got.... but I remember it being very mediocre. Overall, I loved the restaurant.

We ate outside which is a little loud, but the inside of the restaurant is pretty small.  The outdoor seating at least doubles the capacity.  Server was great, very attentive.  Little things bugged me life my knife was not clean, butter was given very sparingly, my lobster bisque while tasty had broken a little.  Over all the food was good, but for as small a place as this is the details are so important.  There were 3 in the party.  Ordered a bottle of wine and a glass of red for my friend. Wine pricing is pretty fair about 100% mark up so about normal.  Trout entre was good, but the sauce while delicious was enough for one filet, but two came on the plate.  Hanger steak was inconsistent.  2 were ordered one was tender and one was not.  Unimpressed with the French onion soup, seemed to lack flavor.

The wine was fantastic! I got the Ros Merlot 2016 and it was delicious. Fragrant but not too sweet- has a nice refreshing feel to it! The arugula salad was amazing. The dressing was perfect and so was the amount of shaved parmesan cheese. The pine nuts also added a really nice flavor. I got the Lamb Ragout and liked it a lot. The potato gnocchi was chewy and the smoked lamb was juicy and tender. The sauce was amazing! It was rich but not too greasy or salty and it paired so well with the gnocchi. My boyfriend got the steak and frites and really enjoyed it too! The steak was perfect medium- the outside was crunchy and the inside was super soft and juicy.

2018-04-03 00:00:00,4.0,"Overall, I really enjoyed Petit Pois and highly recommend trying this French-style restaurant. While the fare is a bit pricier than other selections on the Downtown Mall, PP really is a step above the rest. The decor is intimate, but rustic, with a countryside interior and a nice outside deck. As the weather cools down in the late afternoon and early evening, the deck gives a nice view of the mall, perfect for a glass of wine with friends and family. The menu offers a variety of food items, with each dish built around seasonal, fresh ingredients. Each dish our group ordered highlighted local ingredients and demonstrated a deep attention to detail. Bellow is a description of the dishes I ordered:

Coq Au Vin: While I typically steer away from ordering chicken at restaurants, this bird was cooked beautifully. The meat was moist throughout and nearly fell off of the bone. The resulting wine sauce had a deep, rich flavor with a nice saltiness. The mushroom and carrot lardon on the top complimented the meal really well, adding nice earthy and herby flavors to the dish. The buttery, purred potatoes were also well executed, providing a great base to soak up the complex flavors.

Side of Brussels Sprouts: These were fantastic; the sprouts were really well roasted, crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside. The parmesan on top added a great saltiness while the bacon offered a rich hearty tone to the meal. The portion was very generous for $5 and ranks among the top in Charlottesville. Might come back to just order wine and a side of these!

Would definitely recommend going to Petit Pois. While the place is a bit small, the food is really well done and offers a nice deviation from the typical American/Southern food found on the mall. The waitstaff was very helpful and the ambiance relaxing and inviting.",101.0,petitpois

I was alone and opted to sit outside on the patio where the hostess gave me a hightop table close to the action. I ordered mussels, French onion soup, and a glass of wine. Overall, it was a-ok but didn't leave me wanting to come back for more. I was particularly letdown by the French Onion Soup. Not sure if it wasn't hot enough or what, but the cheese was a strange texture and I found it all rather bland. The mussels were more flavorful but didn't have a ton of broth to soak up with the bread which is usually the best part! 

I don't know if it was because I was by myself, but the service could've also been better. I was there for a full meal but found the waitress to be inattentive and she didn't let me know of specials which I ended up overhearing her tell neighboring tables later on in my meal... It was my first time at the restaurant so a little more warmth would be appreciated and I would've also probably got dessert but didn't want to overstay my welcome.

The risotto was actually an appetizer but at $12 it's a super good deal as it's almost entree-sized. It was decadent and I could taste the parmesan in every bite! I tried a bit of my boyfriend's dish too--the crabcake was a little dry for my taste but overall the dish was good and he seemed to enjoy it a lot.

The service, on the other hand, was a disaster. As in, there was no service. Our server was the only employee working the front of house (there wasn't even a separate host/hostess) and had probably around 10 tables to cover. When we arrived, we waited for about 5 minutes to be seated by the server, which was fine, although the restaurant wasn't crowded at that point so that was a bit odd. I ordered the butternut squash risotto, but in our server's hurry I guess she put in the wrong order and that's how I ended up with an appetizer instead of an entree (although as I said earlier it was excellent so not a huge deal). Our server was nearly running from one table to the next the entire time we were dining, which was stressful to watch and honestly a bit distracting. We were not asked how our meal was once nor were our water glasses refilled despite being empty for 3/4 of the time we were there. Even getting our server's attention for the check was difficult because she would dash inside before we could catch her.

It was easy to get seated on Saturday lunchtime, and we chose to sit outdoors (we ended up being chilly because it was blustery and out of the sun but the warm food helped).

Between four people, we decided to go family-style with the appetizers of French onion soup, lamb mergeuz soup, and gnocchi. Due to an accident, we got the shrimp risotto (uncharged that we got to keep), and it ended up being one of the best apps. The lamb mergeuz soup was delectable, very unique in flavor and well-balanced in my opinion, bringing a good earthy meaty taste alongside the tender beans and carrots. The French onion soup was done well. While the risotto looked like it had been sitting out for a moment (a bit congealed looking), it tasted phenomenal and was the best risotto I've ever had. It was not overly cheesy or buttery, just perfectly creamy held up by some of the flavor of shrimp. The gnocchi ended up being the weakest app; while the gnocchi were so tender and pillowy, the flavors were confusing, dominated by salt and strangely mingling tangy, herby, and nutty flavors. 

I personally ordered the crab cake and loved my choice. Without excess breading, the crab cake was satisfying and had an excellent flavor including notes of citrus and mustard(?) that went great with the sweet creamed corn -- I was indifferent about the spinach.

The wine was fine.
The beet and feta salad that my wife ordered, asking our waitress to kindly check that it was arugula free, as she is 911 allergic to it, duly arrived... almost completely arugula! A replacement eventually arrived with kale (the waitress told us it would be Romaine!) and some tiny little cubes of processed, very un-Greek feta.
I ordered the burger, medium rare, only to be told that it only came 'pink or not pink'. I chose the pink version. When it arrived it was...
grey, soggy, tasteless maybe related to a cow but not to a burger. I asked the waitress if she thought it was 'pink or not pink' and she agreed it was not pink and said sh'e'd get another one that would be, indeed, pink.

$13 - The beet, pistachio, goat cheese and orange salad was ok. Good, not the east I've had.

$26 - Trout Almandine. So. Much. Fish. It was like a whole filet. The skin was perfectly crispy with a healthy portion of sliced almonds in capers.  The green beans were nicely cooked and not mushy (but not crisp either which is my preference). Only thing missing was some citrus.",112.0,petitpois

It is small and cramped.  They can't do anything about that.  The service has always been top notch, warm, hospitable, engaging and friendly without being over the top.  While nothing we have ever eaten there has been memorable; that isn't a slight.  Everything has always been good and of the value that we have paid.  A place like this with its' price point need to make good food that is better than what I can do at home and better than a chain or corporate ""faux"" bistro.  Along with the good food and the exceptional service they always hit the mark.
Last night was the 2nd time we have come in for a New Years Eve meal.  We live within walking distance to the downtown mall and we aren't party animals so we typically don't make NYE reservations and just walk down to the strip and see if we can saddle up at a bar somewhere.  Last week my fiancee mentioned that this year she would like to make reservations and go out.  I searched everywhere in Charlottesville and the surrounding area and all reservations were booked up.  Bummer.  So, we decided to do our regular routine, put on decent clothes and walk and see if we could slide in somewhere----our first choice as Petit Pois.  We go there and talked to the host to see if there was anything possible available, knowing the probability was low and we were OK with that.  The host checked, talked to his folks, came out and showed us to a table.  Yes, it was small and it was cramped but THEY MADE IT HAPPEN FOR US.  Everything was what we expected.

When I came here tonight, I realized that the location for the restaurant is close by to many places I visit regularly: downtown mall and central campus. However, despite having been to DOMA several times, I missed this store before deciding to come tonight. Fortunately, I decided to change things up today.

Public Fish & Oyster from the outside and inside looks like a homey, modern seafood bar. And its menu reflects this aesthetic: it has a small, but well composed menu of delectable seafood dishes. Tonight, I honestly had a hard time choosing what to eat from the many great selections on the menu. Luckily, I had some Yelp help: I went with some Clark Island oysters from the Raw Bar and the wine risotto. My friend ordered the grilled char. 

Both of us were extremely impressed with our personal dishes. My risotto was a beautiful wine stained color, and the wine gave a great tang to the dish that conplemented the mellow flavor of the mushrroms. My friend's char was perfectly cooked and seasoned excellently.

This place is a seafood restaurant and has fresh raw oysters available on the daily.  The chalkboard showcases the varietals and prices - they go from least to most briny top to bottom.  For us, we opt for the brinier the better!  Other menu features include the calamari appetizer, the clam chowder, and the moules frites!  Calamari app is enough to share and comes with some nice veggies.  The calamari is not excessively breaded so you can REALLY taste the squid.  The clam chowder is tasty and creamy and hits the spot, especially on cold days.  The moules frites is enough to share for sure!  The fra diavola is a nice veggie option with tomatoes and spice.  The chorizo sauce has a nice kick to it as well.  My favorite though is the thai-inspired broth with coconut milk!   

Most recently, we split the steampot and it was equally impressive.  For $36 you get a pot with steamed mussels, clams, shrimp and crab legs!  There are also potatoes and corn chunks in there as well.  Now, as much as I enjoyed this dish - i would still order the moules frites over this next time.  The variety was nice, but the flavor was less so - makes sense because it is steamed seafood gofigure :)

Dessert wise, we tried the key lime pie and the blackberry slump - which was described perfectly as a cobbler and a muffin combo.  The crust is definitely bready like a muffin!  The ice cream on top really complements the dessert.

Despite a small space it still feels like you have privacy and you don't hear more than a light murmur in the background. People were dressed semi casual with some people in dark jeans and a blouse or button up. Some people were dressed in dresses but everyone looked put together but suits are not required.

The bartender recommended a cocktail for me which was light and refreshing and they were to die for. We of course got oysters (clearly an unsaid requirement) as well as their heirloom tomato appetizer. Any time you see a restaurant with heirloom tomatoes as an appetizer you know they are going to be fresh and worth-while. And nothing disappointed! Their oyster list is expansive and they all tasted fresh. I went with someone who is a very big fan of oysters and he instantly saw two types he knew he loved and wanted. Based off what he ordered our waiter made some recommendations. Which were quite a hit. 

What brought me to the restaurant was the happy hour special ... the lobster roll! They have both Maine and Connecticut style. There is no wrong way to order a lobster roll but I got Connecticut style. It was fantastic. The meat was tender and the roll was perfectly buttery and soft. My partner's meal was equally as delicious. We both agreed this was some of the best seafood we've had here in Charlottesville.

As a big ice cream fan we had to order the house made ice cream which was creamy and flavorful. We split a key lime pie which was so delicious we might have to go back just to ensure we can have another slice! It was tart and sweet wrapped up in each little bite. The graham cracker crust was buttery and really rounded it out.

My SO had never tried raw oysters before. The staff here did an awesome job explaining and recommending different oysters to try from their oyster bar. And hats off to their oyster shuckers - they make a beautiful plate and they do an awesome job at presenting a clean, ready-to-enjoy oyster. We went to another oyster bar the other day and there was a noticeable difference (couldn't even eat the oysters, it was still attached to the shell). I feel like this is one of the only places that I trust with raw oysters!

Every time we've visited, the staff have been exceptional. I think they are doing a great job at contactless dining with QR code menus and plenty of distance between tables. I've really enjoyed their outdoor dining experience as well - even on a cold November night, the heaters make things super cozy, and the ambiance is very chill (great for people watching...at a distance!) 

I still don't think Virginia can do crab cakes like Maryland (as a proud Marylander) but this place has the best Virginia crab cakes I've ever had.

The interior has such a cute, southern vibe, and I really enjoyed its aesthetic! We sat outside, which was very nice as well. 

For drinks, we ordered their special rose and white wine of the day, which was really delicious and paired super well with our oysters. 

I loved the bread that came out in the beginning, and I'm not sure if I was just super hungry or it was just that good...

We also ordered Belgian fries with garlic aioli, which was fantastic.

Now for the main event, their oysters!!! We decided to go with one of each of theirs (see my menu picture), so it was like a ""flight"" of oysters. It went from least brine-y to most brine-y (same with the menu picture). I enjoy my oysters to be very brine-y, so I really enjoyed the latter oysters, but they were all fantastic!!

Started with a cocktail, as they have a nicely put together cocktail list... The Heck Boy was great! Made perfectly and exactly what I expected based on the description in the cocktail list. I then switched to wine, as they have an interesting wine list, mostly all the unique/boutique wines that aren't the typically popular stuff, which is a nice way to try something new that might become your new favorite. In fact, while there, I tried a French white that I let a (level 2) somm friend know about and he had just had the same wine and raved about it - good options here!

I enjoyed a nice starter salad, followed by their outstanding calamari, which was very fresh and unique, with Asian flavors and Asian style cucumbers on top. Then moved on to some shrimp cocktail, which was decent, but probably the most disappointing part of the meal (reason: The shrimp was a size, slightly 2 sizes too small for traditional , hi-end restaurant shrimp cocktail and it was pre-seasoned with Old Bay style seasoning and it was definitely pre-cooked too far ahead of time to order).

The next course was the entrée! Butter poached halibut (which I got just ""the for the halubit!"") - OUTSTANDING! The carrot puree that is was sitting on top of was great! The sunchokes were interesting, but then again, this was my first time having sunchokes.

Last course was a Key Line Pie - AWESOME! And a glass of madeira to go with it - they paired nicely.

And, since I can appreciate any restaurant that changes my opinion, I had to give Publics 5 stars for converting me from an oyster skeptic into a novice oyster snob. 

For the starters, I tried the roasted rainbow carrots and the calamari. The roasted rainbow carrots absolutely blew me away! They were creamy and the sauce was incorporated into the dish so well that every bite had flavor in it(something I would have never expected from a vegetable so simple). The calamari was pretty fresh too and not oily but a little hard to chew. Then, for the entree, we got the duo of jumbo crab cakes, which also were very fresh but a little too salty for me.

I had made a reservation, but made a mistake by not booking the patio (due to health issues, I try to do most things outdoors). The staff were super understanding and went way out of their way to add an additional table on the patio so that I felt comfortable eating there. I was honestly shocked and so appreciative.

2022-06-25 00:00:00,5.0,"I was visiting Charlottesville for the day with my girlfriend. We decided that we wanted seafood while visiting the mountain community of Charlottesville. We found this restaurant online. It had good ratings, so we gave it a try.

I started with the New England Clam Chowder. OMG! It was so smooth...typically. I add pepper to any New England Clam Chowder. Not this one. It was perfectly seasoned and the broth was so creamy and smooth, and there were plenty of clams.

Not long after, the Steamer Pot arrived. It was steaming and very well seasoned. We had 2 small clusters of crab legs, a whole mess of clams, 8 huge shrimp, a couple of potatoes, and 1 ear of corn.

Everything tasted fresh. My meal paired well with my drink, a Bloody Mary.  The mix used in the Bloody Mary was delicious.  I tasted a pepper flavor, but almost like a lightly burnt pepper flavor that I had not tasted in other mixes. It is spiced perfectly for me - not too hot; not too mild.

There was plenty of food in this steamer pot for two. Looking back, it was a bigger bowl of New England Clam Chowder than I expected. The prices are fair for the food and service you receive. The staff are wonderful! And the bartenders are exceptionally skilled. 

At the end of our Steamer Pot, I requested a whiskey sour. I enjoy a good whiskey sour.  I am not ashamed to say, tonight I enjoyed a great whiskey sour. I don't know what he did to make that drink so smooth. It was the perfect balance of the sour mix, the whiskey, and butter. That drink was buttery smooth. 

Overall, my girlfriend and I agree that the food was delicious. Good job, cooks/chefs. The service was fantastic! Everyone was friendly and out of the way helpful.  The ambiance was nice. It was cozy inside. And the barkeeps were on their game. The drinks were amazing.

2022-07-07 00:00:00,2.0,"Summary: all the food LOOKS very good but TASTES bad. 

Full review: To get to the point, it seems like this place has really good ideas for food but hasn't quite gotten to the point of making it taste good. It was super busy the night we visited, but we nabbed some bar seats right as we went in.

We got a bunch of oysters that were pretty standard. The special was a ""rare ahi tuna"" that was closer to ""100% cooked for 1 cm and completely raw for the rest."" The fish actually looked really good but the texture combination of raw+cooked did not work. The curry underneath, a bog standard red thai curry, was great with the rice.

The Hodgepodge lived up to it's named and there was actually quite a lot of mussel. Unfortunately the soup base was weak and the entire bowl needed a lot of salt to bring the flavor out. The table bread that accompanied was also just a small stick of white that left a lot to be desired.",10.0,publicfish

The service was great throughout the night and our server was very attentive and friendly. We ended up ordering a round of oysters and shrimp cocktail and it was just as tasty as I remembered--highly recommended for those who love a good briny set of oysters! 

*Shrimp po-boy - this was a tasty entree and wile I wouldn't say it was the best ever, it certainly hit the spot. The fries that came with it were excellent and happened to be my favorite style of fries. They also give you a ton so you'll likely leave stuffed.

*Brussels sprouts - these were really good. The sauce that these are prepared/mixed in really made these stand out from the usual Brussel sprouts from other restaurants. Would certainly order again. 

*Chicken sandwich - wife ordered this and she enjoyed her selection as well. This also came with a mountain of fries so she too, walked out of these stuffed.

2022-08-07 00:00:00,3.0,"Came here last night to dine in. I've been here at least 5 times now and it's clear there is quite a bit of inconsistency in both the quality of service and food. 
I made a reservation for dinner at 6 pm and they were sold out of the lobster rolls. I was a bit sad about that. I guess I just missed it bc the people that were sat next to us got lobster rolls. 
We ordered two drinks and oysters before the happy hour ended at 6 pm. Only Virginia oysters have a dollar discount during happy hour. 
I ordered their steak frites and my friend got the sockeye salmon. 
The drinks came out first naturally but the bartender who brought the drink winked at my friend making her feel uncomfortable. 
Then to my surprise, the main food came out first before the oysters. I thought the order for oysters were placed first and they are appetizers. When I inquired about why the oysters haven't come out first, the waitress said that their oysters come from all over the place so it takes a while for them to get them ready. Also, she mentioned that there is no particular order of how the food comes out. 
I was confused at that explanation. Appetizers should come out before the main? The oysters come from everywhere?? I mean, shouldn't they have the oysters in house already?? I clearly saw them at the front when I was checking in at the restaurant on a pile of ice. 
The fries during this visit was soggy and over cooked. During my previous visits, the fries were nice, crisp, and yellow. not greasy and dark looking. Perhaps the humidity had something to do with it?

I also felt like I was being looked down upon during this visit. Not sure why though. Students are on summer break so the majority of people dining in were the age group of the students' parents. We were one of the youngest diners here. Felt like I was being judged based on how I was dressed and being a younger generation who couldn't afford being here.

I like to get my oyster shots virgin so I can get full flavor of the mix/oyster. The clam chowder is perfect for a chilly day. It's hearty, creamy and has plenty of clams veggies. The chilled lobster roll is my go to. It's light and the bun is not too buttery so doesn't give you a weighed down feeling. My guy usually gets something different each time, lobster roll, crab cake sandwich, fish special, etc. I can't recall the special for this past Sunday but he thoroughly enjoyed it.

Additionally, we got two oysters shooters, which, if you love Bloody Mary's, these would be right up your alley!

As an appetizer, we ordered the corn ""ribs,"" which were amazing. Surprisingly, they were our favorite food all night! For mains, we got the sea scallops and the PFO pot roast. They were both so delicious! The scallops were five pleasantly plump and seared to perfection with a nice refreshing corn salsa. The pot roast was superb and creamy and so delicious!

The location was super nice. It was nicely decorated, and their patio was very pretty. Our server was super helpful and checked on us all night. He did a great job!

Our one con was: we were sitting outside, and the pitcher of water they were pouring into the cups was filled with small bugs since they left the pitcher outside. It happened several times to us. It was a very small issue, though!

We got to our reservation on time and had the worst seat in the restaurant, we were sandwiched between two tables and extremely close to the bar. I completely understand tables have to be close together especially in a busy restaurant on a Saturday night but it was hard for the waitress to get to us and I felt like it was almost used as an excuse to be neglected. When we ordered we ordered everything together because again, it was hard for our waitress to get to our table. We ordered a dozen oysters, a $90 bottle of wine and I got the moules frites and my husband got the shrimp linguini and I also got the ABC bread to dip in the broth of the mussels. I should have mentioned we wanted the oysters as an app but assumed it was an appetizer and the entrees would come after, but the waitress also never asked. We got everything all together, which was such a pain. Since the table was small I had to put the mussels bucket on the floor and we barely had any room for anything. I know I should have mentioned to get the appetizer first, but I also think the waitress should have asked. At a nice restaurant, they need to ask. I also never got the bread. 
The worst part was after we got the food, the waitress literally never came back. Never came back to ask how the food turned out, no water refills, no asking if we wanted something else to drink, literally nothing. So I couldn't even tell her the bread was missing. She was also very attentive to the table next to us, so I cant even blame it on her seeming to be busy. When she finally came back, when the restaurant was basically closing, we mentioned the bread. She brought it out and with extra and took it off our tab. She acted like she was doing a huge favor taking it off the tab, like thanks? The broth was cold by then and it was $4, I wasnt worried about paying for it, I actually wanted it with my meal.
All that being said, the food was very good, and the restaurant was beautiful. I would love to try it again and hope that it was just an off night. But I was very much looking forward to a nice night out with my husband for our anniversary, especially when you get a babysitter and spend a good bit of money on the meal, you'd hope to get better service.",4.0,publicfish

Now for the food! WOW. Plated beautifully, bursting with fresh flavor and no over the top seasonings. We selected the calamari, ceviche, oysters Rockefeller and fried oysters as starters for our table. The calamari with pickled vegetables seemed odd, but man what a killer combo, it was amazing! The ceviche was also a highlight on the tastebuds. And the serving sizes were large enough for our table of 4 to share easily. The main entrees we ordered were Rockfish and lobster roll. Super good and cooked to perfection! Dessert: keylime pie (get it, you won't be disappointed) Olive Oil cake and the chocolate pot. All exceptional and served with housemaid whipped cream. 

The ambiance is cozy yet casual and fun. You can tell this place is run with love and pride, and it shows in every detail. We'll definitely be back and recommending this gem to everyone we know.

The Brussel sprouts are topped with bacon and shaved almonds.

The shrimp and grits were great! They were cooked just right. The shrimp were very large! It's a large portion. I originally asked for Bleu cheese when I ordered a salad. The salad came with ranch.

I had the roasted chicken, Tammy had the Shrimp and Grits with andouille sausage and we shared apps. 

We weren't drinking, but if I find myself in Charlottesville again, I'm gonna try their signature old fashioned with VA Bourbon. 

The deviled eggs had enough mustard to cut through the extra creamy blend with a shard of bacon on each that elevated them beyond normal. The jalapeño cornbread was a sublime mix of sweet and heat. 

The chicken was perfectly cooked and the carrots roasted to a turn. They were just starting to soften on the outside while still crispy in the center.  I truly enjoyed the roasted pearl
onions which popped in your mouth like flavor bombs. The mashed potatoes where divinely blended.  The grace notes with the rosemary spear and the seasoned salt surrounding the dish so you could spice to preference, individually, on each bite were brilliant.

I realize that there has been a pandemic and that hiring/staffing/training are extremely challenging.

The wine, beer and cocktails: Great, no complaints. 

The food.  Two plates of RAW oysters came out that were *hot* to the touch. I've never seen this in all my years...

I ordered steak frites (medium).  The steak was bland, over-cooked and tasteless. The fries were mushy as if in a soup.  I didn't know this dish could be so mishandled.

Then, I waited....another woman came out to bring me my salad, which was delicious.  I told her that I had not gotten my water or glass of wine.  She apologized and said that my wine would be comped, which was very thoughtful.  I ate my salad and waited for 10 minutes to ask for my check, the server never came out of the kitchen.

First off, we pulled into the Valet parking, and they told us that parking was for hotel guests only, and that we would have to find a parking garage which was a couple blocks away.  That's crap.  He did show us a lot across the way which was sketchy at best.

Next we checked in with the hostess and as we were walking to our table she asked if we wouldn't mind sharing a menu.  Really.....out of menu's.  She seated us at a small table and we asked if we could have the table near the window so we can keep an eye on the lot where our car was parked.  The floor manager came by and said that that table was reserved and people had reservations and were waiting.  I said, we had reservations too, and she (Kim is her name) rudely insisted that we take our table because the other table was reserved.  At that point we almost walked out...We opted to at least try the cuisine.

After a few minutes, the server finally came, by that time we had all our choices made.  I ordered the Ribeye and my wife ordered the Crab Cakes. (all different than online menu)  My wife orders a white wine with her entrée and I ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon with mine.  She got her White and I also received a white.  As she was scurrying away I called her back and told her I ordered a red.  She said let me check to see what you ordered.  Really....I know what I ordered and a cab is a red.  She came back and said the Bartender made the mistake. 

The food did come a little over 10 minutes from order (we had a timer going) which was impressive.  My wife said the crab cakes were pretty good and my ribeye was good, not great and a restaurant of this caliber ought to be.  The steak was on top the mashed potatoes and asparagus and when I went to cut the steak and the mashed potatoes oozed out from under the steak and all the steak juice was in the potatoes which I would rather pool on the place to swab my bites in. 

In summary, sounds like the restaurant is for guests only, based on no parking for outsiders.  Kim the floor manager is rude and there were not enough menu's.  Food was good, not great, which a restaurant of this caliber should present.

By the way, at the time we were leaving, nobody was ever seated at the table by the window we requested.  They merged it with another table which STILL, nobody was sitting at when we left.  So Kim lied to us!  No reservations for a small table.

Overall the food was average, nice portions. Our server was less than stellar, took along time to get our drinks to table and to take our order. I haf th cajun pasta and added blackened chicken. Food came, and the chicken was not blackened at all. Server made a comment it had sear marks..?  Our other group had some food cooking temp issues with chicken. Our group had to insist with their server it wasnt prepared to proper cooking temp and chicken had visible signs of red colors. The dish was Sent back to finish cooking and after 30 minutes passed the food came back out. By this time every person in the party had finished eating. This person was very upset and her server did nothing to make it right. 
I'm being very generous with a 2 star rating. I feel the setup for out group was not right..the service was less than adequate and the food prices for this lack of food options, quality and service was horrific. 
The Ridley was very disappointing for the amount of money being spent by their customers. 
Thank You 
Dave F....very sad customer!",256.0,ridley

I really try to avoid bad or even mid star reviews.  But my family and I are in town to celebrate a wedding and wanted to try The Ridley out for dinner.  

We were able to make a reservation on open table for a Friday night at the time we wanted which was great.  We were seated right away, and greeted with water and our waitress fairly quickly.

Hurriedly, she said she would be right back to take our drink order... at least 20 minutes later, we finally make eye contact and she rushes over and verbatim says ""I'm so sorry, I completely forgot about you"" .... yikes!

At this point we've wised up to what's going on and luckily knew to put our drink and dinner orders at the same time. 

We get the food before our drinks, never a good sign... my lobster roll was okay, but the fries were cold.  Dad's burger was good, cooked how he likes but nothing special, his fries were warm.  Mom's salad was good, but needed pepper, it took another 10 minutes to get our waitress to come back for something simple.

Finally, our drinks were made and brought out over 1/2 way through dinner (this is about 30 minutes after we've ordered them).  Again, our waitress rushes over ""I'm sorry for the delay, our bartenders are terrible"" sets the drinks down and then rushes off to God knows where, because she wasn't checking on other tables either. The thing I'd been looking forward to after a long day of travel was their Old Fashioned (my favorite and go to cocktail), presentation was good but the drink was unfortunately mixed terribly, took one sip and didn't touch the drink after.  For $21 you expect it to at least taste correct.

Another 15 minutes or so after we've finished our meal we have to flag her down yet again to get our check.  Another table locally was waiting to pay their bill for at least 20-25 minutes for her to come back.

Shelly was a great waitress, super friendly and attentive.  She encouraged us to try the grits and the homemade buttermilk biscuit with our omelets - both great choices.  Topped it off with a peach mimosa!  Definitely coming back next time I'm in Charlottesville.",1.0,ridley
2024-07-02 00:00:00,3.0,"We stopped in Charlottesville for a few days to do some sight seeing. This place has a cool decor which caught my eye as we were driving in to the hotel. We decided to sit at the bar and although the place did not seem to be that busy, the bartender appeared to be overwhelmed. We ordered some cocktails; my wife's Pine Apple-lime martini was excellent, I on the other hand ordered a dirty martini and ended up with a less than dirty martini, if fact, no dirt at all. It was Belvedere Vodka, which on its own is good, the bar tender, although very nice, Houdini. The Oysters looked  appealing, we like them raw and at $32 for a dozen, and that they are shucked to order, have to be good right? Oysters are best served ""cold"", not luke warm, and normally on a bed of ""ice"". Secondly for $2.67 a piece, these Oysters were anemic, with no vinaigrette, crackers, etc. which the menu says come with them. The bottle of Prosecco helped wash them down. Ok, being adventurous, we pressed forward our drinks plus the Prosecco were kicking in. My wife ordered the Caesar salad with the shrimp which she said was delicious and I ordered the buffalo seasoned  cauliflower. Seasoning, ehhh, but the cauliflowers were good size. Desert martini was the ""Wahoo Daiquiri"", delicious. Moral of story .. stop in for a Signature Martini or Daiquiri, roll the dice on food, enjoy the ambiance.",32.0,ridley
2024-07-18 00:00:00,2.0,"Went in for restaurant week with reservations at 7pm. The hostess was very friendly in seating us and our server brought over water while the other member of my party had left the table. She stated she would return to introduce herself when he returned. He returned to the table and she didn't return for almost 10 minutes.  She took our drink orders and we ordered our appetizers. She returned several minutes later to let me know they were out of the items to make the extra credit passion fruit cocktail, so I ordered the wahoo daiquiri instead, my date had ordered an unsweetened tea; which had yet to arrive in this time frame. We sat and talked and waited for our appetizers to arrive. My drink arrived about 15 minutes later and we began to wonder about our food. At which time, we'd been waiting awhile since placing the order and had watched several couples/parties come in after us and get their appetizers by now. 45 minutes in to being there, we finally got our appetizers. The cornbread was hot and delicious. The shrimp cocktail was warm and slimy, not so great. We both ordered the chicken and waffles and it came out not long after our appetizers; which didn't surprise us. The chicken was hot and flavored well. The waffles had so much cinnamon butter on them, it made them cold to eat. But when put together, it wasn't bad. When it came time to order desert, one of the reasons I chose this specific restaurant for dinner, they stated they didn't have the crème brûlée that was on the restaurant week menu. That it hadn't set and wasn't available, so they could offer the banana pudding or a slice of cheesecake with berries. What a disappointment this was. After the terrible service we had, this just ruined any good that had come from the food. We ordered the cheesecake to go and when it came out in the to go containers, it was more of a sliver than a slice. It looked like they took a slice and cut it on half to share with two people. We paid our bill and asked the server for a bag to carry out the to go containers in and she stated she would be back with it, to which she never did. We had to ask her 3 additional times for the bag before we finally got one to use. This was one of the worst service experiences in dining I've had. The cornbread was amazing and I would come just for that. But the rest lacked anything to be desired. I understand things happen in a kitchen and places run out of things, but when it's restaurant week and you've posted a specific menu; that menu should be followed. If you're unable to, that should be stated upfront when your sat at the table, as they had known all day. Disappointing start to my first time in Charlottesville for restaurant week.",13.0,ridley

2024-08-19 00:00:00,1.0,"We will never dine here again - the only thing the Ridley has going for it is the ambiance. It is a really nice looking restaurant - but this is not a quality restaurant at all. The service was honestly despicable. I will note we had a party of 10, but even the small tables around us were complaining, and the restaurant was not even busy. The bad service was very clearly an ongoing issue and unrelated to our party size. Our server was extremely slow and never bothered to ask if we wanted refills. The kitchen was also bad. Everyone's meals came out at different times, and took forever. We were there just over two hours but not because we were leisurely enjoying our meals - over half our table got salads and two others got sandwiches and one set of ribs. While I could understand the ribs taking some time, they were actually the first out of the kitchen. One salad didn't even come until after everyone else had finished. I personally got a Caesar salad with steak cooked med rare. The steak was more well done and the salad wasn't even tossed and the dressing tasted like it had gone bad. Also of note, several people got the same salad, but they came out looking completely different. For example - two people got the beet salad but one came out in a large bowl and had goat cheese and other little bits but the other was on a small side plate without any cheese or anything. Same with the Caesar salads - all the plates were different. By the end, we could not wait to leave. For an Autograph Collection hotel, this restaurant was an absolute miss. Save your time while in Cville and avoid the Ridley - there are plenty of wonderful restaurants with solid service and great food!",61.0,ridley
2024-08-22 00:00:00,1.0,"My partner and I were there Wednesday evening, August 14. That was the fifth night of what was otherwise a truly wonderful road trip vacation. We stood waiting for probably 10 minutes before a sullen, shabbily dressed young woman arrived to seat us. She greeted us with attitude and one word ""Two?"" She grabbed two menus, whirled around and showed us to a tiny high top table. My partner asked if we could be seated at one of the two empty booths just 4 or 5 steps away. That's when the young woman's performance began. She charged off, returned with a wet rag and began furiously to clean both of the empty booths. Literally snarling, she seated us at one of the booths, and threw two menus on the table. Momentarily she returned and literally threw two small plates in front of us. Both of the plates actually bounced. She left and never returned, although she was racing around the nearly empty restaurant the entire time we were seated with no apparent purpose, obviously angry at the world, not just us. After we were seated, we waited another ten minutes before I got up to go find a server, as none had appeared. That server was lovely, kind and efficient.The food was okay, but the night was completely ruined for us by the hideous behavior of the hostess. I cannot remember a worse restaurant experience ever, anywhere. I would avoid this place. Period.",1.0,ridley

Sat at the bar and looked at eh menu for 5-10 minutes with nothing looking good. Settled on a Grilled Chicken sandwich and swapped the fries for collard greens. Sandwich came with Mayo on it... Disgusting . Scraped off what I could and tried to eat it as I was hungry. Absolutely zero seasoning -no salt, no pepper, nothing. I don't even think it was grilled. Tried a bit of the collards and they were old and really shredded up. I love hot sauce, but someone had added some to this to cover how old they were. A 20oz Miller Lite (that smelled like a dirty dish towel) and a crappy chicken sandwich was $37. Run anywhere but here.",90.0,ridley

About 10 minutes after seating we were greeted by our bartender/server who said "" sorry, usually they let us know if they seat these tables."" Certainly didn't make us feel welcome and it felt like our seating was an afterthought despite me making this reservation weeks in advance. The jalepeno cornbread was fine. I wish I could tell you how any of the other food was... but after 45 minutes of sitting and not placing our entree order we lost hope and flagged down the bartender to pay our bill.

It took over 20 minutes from the time our group sat down to place an order. Our waiter was constantly nowhere to be found and it took forever to get his attention for anything. A table next to ours received their food before us despite the fact that they arrived after us. By the time our food eventually came, it was extremely cold and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while -- which wouldn't be a surprise since our waiter seemed to forget about our table altogether. And if that all wasn't enough, after we got our receipt (once we managed to get our waiter's attention), we realized that we were charged for TWO sandwiches despite only ordering one. Attaching the photo of our receipt here for proof since the restaurant refuses to answer their phone -- again, not a shocker. To top it all off, the delayed (lack of) service almost made us late for my friend's out-of-town departure.
