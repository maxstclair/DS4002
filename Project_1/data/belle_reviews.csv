MP G.,20/04/19,1,,4,5,"Just had an iced decaf Americano coffee with soy. They're still newly getting coordinated but since changing over from La Taza, they kept a lot of the same layout but just added new painting and design. Clean, sleek design and interior with some outdoor seating. Looking tor try their food sometime soon and wine.",234,228
Novianti B.,23/04/19,1,,3,5,"Love this new spot in Belmont. Belle located at former La Tazza location. Parking available also street parking. Surrounded by other Belmont restaurants, Belle surely a great addition. I ordered focaccia with cheese, and cappuccino. Both are delicious. You can have free coffee refill with food order and free wifi, patio seating (so you can bring your fur baby). Definitely a must go!!!'",240,7
Valorie E.,02/05/19,,1,2,3,"Awe I really wanted this restaurant to be good & had high hopes.  First and foremost, it is a very sterile spot and didn't feel very welcoming.  The menu was extremely limited.  I ended up getting eggs with a side of bacon.  I sat down and someone yelled out my name when the order came up.  We weren't sure if we heard it correctly one time and grabbed someone else's (but went back up to confirm).  The bacon WAS good as was the eggs and bread, however, my plastic utensils broke and the cardboard box walls were so tall that it was difficult to eat and I ended up ripping the top off.  It seemed like such a huge waste of paper and the trash can was overflowing with big boxes.  I really hope they're working out the kinks and that they do have a legitimate brunch one day.  It was a great spot!  The coffee is also meh.  I heard another patron mention it as well and they just dumped it out.  I hope to update this review one day soon with something cool!",219,451
M K.,03/05/19,1,,2,5,"Very pleased with my first trip here. Great simple decor, homemade latte syrups, and tons of seating for working. Hoping they grow their grab-and-go food options, like pastries etc. over time so it's easier to just have a light bite with my coffee. Look forward to seeing this spot stick around.",82,2
Laura S.,16/05/19,,,1,5,Airy new spot with lots of light and a good vibe.   Their house made English muffins and fried mushroom poppers are delish!!!,42,184
Mary Kate A.,05/06/19,4,,1,4,"Adorable coffee & wine shop! Parking in Belmont is always tricky, but they have a few spots right out front if you get lucky with timing! 
The service is excellent, but the prices are a bit high and there is a limited food menu. However, it's a nice stop for a quick brunch or happy hour on their patio with friends!",14,175
Michael E.,09/06/19,1,,1,4,"Big fan!  coffee and food is amazing.  A bit slow, but I did not really mind since the output was always excellent!",19,
Bernadette P.,11/06/19,,,,5,Belle is a great addition to the Belmont area! I love the aesthetic and everyone who works there is pleasant. I also have to say that their bagels are the BEST in Charlottesville (sorry Bodos).,1,223
Sam A.,21/06/19,,2,1,3,"Stopped in and got the chicken club. Good in theory but not in execution. Just way to much on the sandwich. The wrapped was soaked in grease. Buttered (made in house, bread was good) with brie, a ton of mayo, bacon, shredded chicken, tomato, pickled onion and arugula. I went through three paper towels eating just half. It didnt need the mayo and the butter and the brie all together. Ate half of it, now I need a shower and a nap.",67,2
Ben S.,25/06/19,1,,1,5,"A welcome addition to Belmont. Before Belle there was no coffee shop or casual breakfast / lunch spot - this fills that requirement! Inside is bright and airy with seating for about twenty, plus they have an outdoor space that doubles capacity. All your standard coffee beverages are available, along with a very vegetarian friendly casual breakfast and lunch menu. Counter order with friendly service. The coffee beverages and pastries we ordered were all great. Prices were reasonable and street parking was easy at that time of day. Definitely recommended!",1128,110
Ben W.,01/07/19,,,,3,"Allow plenty of time if you're planning on grabbing a quick bite or cup of coffee before work; the service has been rather slow each time that I've gone. The food is decent (I recommend the bacon, egg, and cheddar on an english muffin), but for the most part, it's nothing you can't get at Bodo's for half the price and twice the efficiency. It's hard to beat the convenience if you live in Belmont but if you don't, you're probably better off spending your time and money elsewhere.",2,44
Michelle F.,03/07/19,1,1,1,4,"A delightful new revamp of La taza's old spot in Belmont. I've been to work at Belle to work a few times in the last couple of weeks and they've made the spot feel elegant and comfortable and super clean! Staff is super friendly and coffee was good.  They have a decent food menu which I really appreciate in a coffee shop. I ordered ""the Witch"" (eggs and cheese on English muffin). The English muffin was homemade which I totally applaud but in this instance it was too big and a bit doughy. However the next time I went I ordered a blueberry muffin and it came fresh from the oven and perfectly cooked!

To note: there is not a lot of individual tables (unless you are outside) just a long bar top area and a long table. Not a problem if things are crowded but could be frustrating for those trying to study you could get squished in.",36,40
Kate D.,02/08/19,1,1,1,5,"I arrived at Belle with a jumpy elderly dog and a toddler at 5pm. Aka three strikes in the hospitality industry. The lady at Belle could not have been more delightful and accommodating. They only do counter service but have tables outside so she brought a menu out so I didn't have to bring the dog in. Toddler had an amazing time with water table and toys on the deck. I had a huge glass of sparkling rose, and all three of us split a enormous slice of banana bread that was ridiculously good and ridiculously priced at $2. So freaking happy that this place opened in our neighborhood. Rose $6. banana bread $2. 20 minutes of calm, priceless.",26,38
Art A.,05/08/19,1,,1,5,"One of the best tasting English muffins I've ever had. The muffin breakfast sandwich was very good. Must have had three eggs, cheese was creamy and they put an adequate amount of bacon in the sandwich.
Coffee is self-serve with a nice large ceramic cup. All breads are baked on premises. Will next try a bagel with lox.",36,
Simon B.,23/08/19,1,,1,5,"Really great English muffins and coffee, friendly service, and a lot of working space with outlets etc.",3,
Christina Z.,25/08/19,3,,3,4,"Cute place to stop for an afternoon of getting work/studying done! There is a good variety of indoor and outdoor seating depending on your mood and plenty of outlets inside to plug in your laptop. The drinks can be a little pricey as expected for a small coffee shop, but the food options are more reasonably priced (both breakfast and lunch available). I had an oat milk latte to start off and then the Kale Caesar as a late lunch which was super tasty (heavily dressed and tossed with lots of shredded parmesan plus in-house made croutons). My husband got ""The Mother"" sandwich which was huuuge and brought his leftovers home. We also shared the Maitake Poppers which were delicious and had a texture similar to tempura/lightly fried calamari. 

Overall, good experience - can get a little loud for studying but quieter down as the afternoon wore on. I definitely would go back to try out their breakfast and mimosa and wine specials (and the patio once it starts cooling off)!",360,52
Louis D.,30/08/19,,,,4,This place has the most amazing blueberry muffins I've ever had. And I also got the chicken club which did not disappoint. Finally there latte was delicious. Overall this place is great. Plenty of seating inside and out. Nice selections of wine as well. Unfortunately parking is scare but if you can find free street parking you are golden.,8,1
Laurie B.,22/09/19,,,1,1,"Waited one hour because they forgot about my order and honestly, it was all kinds of not worth the wait. Go to Hotcakes. This place sucks.",2,
Perry B.,22/09/19,1,,1,4,"Best lox bagel in Cville! Well balanced and delicious. The everything bagel reminds me of NYC. Cute space to study, chat or hangout. The cold brew is pretty good as well. My friend had an iced americano that she liked. Took off a star because they have been out of chai forever and bagel is a bit pricey ($10).",150,22
Andrea S.,06/10/19,,,,4,Very tasty breakfast and coffees (oat milk latte!) on way to visit Monticello. Outdoor seating could use some fly traps but really chill and cute place... and did I mention super good food?! Overall well worth the detour!!,4,
Tiffany L.,26/11/19,,,,5,"Met up for breakfast with a friend and tried their coffee, english muffin, and bagel with homemade cream cheese. Everything was delicious, but especially the english muffin! Relaxed vibe inside with plenty of seating. Only downside is parking is atrociously difficult with a teeny tiny lot.",1365,139
Angelena G.,18/01/20,,,1,2,I came to Belle on a Saturday morning around 10:30 and they were already out of half of the things on the menu. I was excited to try their homemade bagels and cream cheese I had seen on their instagram but the menu was completely different than everything posted online. What was available was limited and just okay... left with a stomach ache.,3,282
Abhaya T.,20/01/20,,1,4,1,"As of sometime near January 19, Belle has taken on two new ""partners"" (does that mean owners?).

And, the menu has changed greatly.

My advice to Belle: without delay change Belle back to EXACTLY how it was before!

Without doing that, you will have ruined what was one of the *very* best things about Charlottesville.

Now, before it's too late, admit your mistake, and bring Belle back to its original magnificence.",6,151
Jennifer A.,29/01/20,,,1,1,"Had read the grest reviews and thought I'd give it a try. Ordered a latte and was told they ""don't do lattes"" but can make a great cup of coffee with whip cream. I'm not sure what coffee shop doesn't make lattes but they won't get my business.",1,
Laurie L.,16/02/20,1,,2,5,"The bread here is amazing. Better than pretty much any other bakery I've been to. The sourdough, the focaccia, the bagels, all are incredible. This place is legit.",32,1
Holly H.,01/03/20,,,4,3,Just stopped in to find they no longer have espresso. Drip coffee only. They are focusing more on the food side of the business now according to the person at the counter. I'm just a bit disappointed.,7,
Amanda S.,15/03/20,,,,4,"This is a super cute coffee shop! Very nice interior and exterior with plenty of natural light. There is patio seating for when the weather is great. The staff was exceptionally friendly as well. I had an amazing cinnamon roll (definitely an item to share, it was huge!) and cup of tea. My friends said the coffee was great too!",103,295
Bill R.,31/05/20,,,,5,I've only been once but OMG. Tasty tasty vittles. Had donuts and cinnamon buns. Can't wait to return for the bagels.,34,
Lena Y.,07/06/20,,,,5,"Did my first order with them over the phone, they got everything right, and very sweetly added a little extra. Fast friendly service, I appreciated that everything looked very clean and everyone was wearing masks. Have not tried everything yet, but the homemade donuts are fabulous! Will definitely return!",3,
Kaley P.,17/07/20,,,,5,"These boys saved this spot. Definitely turned it into what it should be and their quick overhaul deserves an applause. Fresh baked goods, outstanding sandwiches, fantastic specials and smiling faces. Belle has become exactly what a little borough like Belmont needed. Great job guys! Hats off to you!",12,
Andrew S.,19/07/20,2,,2,5,"Belle is awesome. Great bread. They're sandwiches are excellent, both for lunch and dinner.",7,
Kailey B.,23/07/20,,,,5,This is one of the best weekend spots in Charlottesville! They have the most flavorful sandwiches that I love for both lunch and dinner. The breakfast scene is also terrific. The cinnamon rolls are to die for and it is such a great atmosphere! The staff is so friendly and it is just a great spot to go to!,3,
Beth M.,30/08/20,,,3,5,"We went to Belle for lunch and loved it so much we wanted to try brunch. I'll start with lunch. 

I had the falafel sandwich and I loved how fresh the falafel was. Clearly it was made with lots of love and was a great vegan option as well. 

For brunch we took the boys. The cinnamon rolls had been calling my name since Friday so we got one to share (they're big and did not wait for a picture). I then had the avocado toast with sunny egg and it was on point. They use their homemade bread for the toast and it's so so good with a thick crunchy crust. He had the avocado, chili paste and egg sandwich on brioche and it looked amazing. The kids shared a #2 - bacon egg and cheese on an English muffin, which was homemade and extra delicious. 

Overall a great spot. It was hopping at both visits so hopefully it will last through CoViD!",207,28
Amy M.,20/09/20,,,1,5,"Delicious brunch! The breakfast sandwiches are out of this world, and the setting of the outside patio/garden couldn't be more perfect. A high recommend!",48,135
Scott M.,23/10/20,,,,5,"Great menu that gets even more Interesting as they introduce new choices. Great friendly service, beautiful patio for outdoor dining and the chefs seem great and know their business. We have gone several times and plan to return-so far so good -and it is relatively new.",27,
Sean C.,14/11/20,1,,1,5,"Great sandwiches at lunch. They make all their own bread, and it's excellent. Highly recommend both the Italian and the. Unanimous.",68,5
Jackie B.,13/01/21,,,2,5,"This place is a hidden gem! It's about one year, and the ambience is so lovely. It has great outdoor seating for those to enjoy when the weather is nice, and plenty of indoor seating as well to be spaced out in the midst of COVID-19.

The food is delicious! They have a great selection of bread, pastries, and sandwiches. My friends and I came in the morning, so we ordered several breakfast sandwiches and donuts. Their #1 sandwich was the bodega, which has sausage, American cheese, egg, on a brioche. Was very good! The other sandwich I tried was the prosciutto cotto, seasonal jam, gruyere on an english muffin. The jam was delicious, and was a nice balance of sweet and savory. The pastries also looked good, and I tried a blueberry donut. It was better than most donuts I had. If I ever visit Charlottesville again, will most definitely be dropping by here!",292,343
Ben M.,14/02/21,,1,3,3,"I wanted to love this place because it is adorable and the food looked amazing. My overall impression after eating here is that was...eh. The presentation is amazing and the atmosphere is cute, but at the end of the day, food didn't impress as it relates to taste. I got an assortment of doughnuts which looked heavenly but they all tasted a little bitter/sour which was odd and I think had something to do with the dough used and not the other flavors. I also got the #1 breakfast sandwich which was huge., but was almost too big because of the amount of egg and not one item on it had much flavor. The bread, which is made by them, was excellent but was overwhelmed by the amount of other ingredients in the sandwich. I would probably go back because it was cute but the flavors need pumped up a bit.",129,272
Kate M.,16/02/21,,,1,5,"Really cute place, good food and coffee, and the door was left open for extra COVID safety.",15,164
Colleen M.,28/02/21,,,,5,Loved the NYC lox. Called ahead and easy pick up. Bagel better than bodos 100%! Recommend,3,
Emily C.,08/03/21,,,2,5,"SNAP  Y'all got us two days in a row. How did you get the #4 trout sandwich to be so wow. Lest us no forget the english muffin and eggs Benny with crispy potatoes.

Lovely outdoor and indoor space. Chic and friendly staff. Counting down the days to till I enjoy a donut...
Nom nom.

Only critique is my formal request for an espresso machine - but will be back no matter.

Do not sleep on BELLE!",31,2
Brian C.,14/04/21,,,,5,"The Lemon Lavender donut was yeasty, subtle, and one of the best donuts I've ever had.  It's not overpowering and has a nice, crisp bite.  

The glazed donut also surprised me at how a simple recipe can be reinvented over and over.  This had an amazing crisp bite with the remnants of sourdough, I believe.  Fantastic!",9,30
Ali S.,25/04/21,,1,,5,"Trust me - you need the prosciutto scone!  It's biscuit-y and has so much flavor! Went two mornings in a row just for this! Lovely, large donuts. Very inexpensive. Great drip coffee!",25,23
Singi D.,28/05/21,,,1,4,"Friendly staff. Only drip coffee or cold brew. Wish they had an espresso machine. Bread is top notch. The grilled cheese was not bad. Tomato soup was diluted, it was just ok.

Clean bathrooms, parking  available, nice place. Maybe I need to try other items. My first time here",485,22
Ethan C.,06/06/21,,,1,1,"Was there with a group of my colleagues. Seven of us ordered sandwiches. Took forever.  Sandwiches eventually came  out. I went to inquire. Rude worker ran out and said, ""Don't touch that"". The so-called manager was a loser and did not address me - just ran away. Because he knew he was wrong.
At $14 a sandwich, I expect a little more.",9,
Jessica J.,13/06/21,1,,,4,"Stopped in around 11am on a Sunday morning expecting to wait but we were seated outside right away.  The food was delicious!  Service was less than stellar but not bad -- we only saw our server once after we ordered (leaving us waiting for coffee refill, etc).  

I ordered the mushroom and gruyere omelet and coffee, boyfriend ordered the Benedict with lox.  We also shared a coffee donut and a cinnamon roll.  The omelette might have been the best I've ever had.  It was light and fluffy and perfectly seasoned.  The side salad was just romaine hearts with light dressing which, as it sounds, was unimpressive.  My boyfriend said his Benedict was very good although the eggs were over easy instead of poached.  The portion of lox was very generous and he finished every bite.  The coffee donut was average.  Not really a lot of coffee flavor but still yummy.  The giant cinnamon roll was worth going back for -- lots of flavor in the roll itself and not just the icing.  It was plenty large enough for us to share.",30,231
Ivy G.,03/07/21,,,1,5,"I know ever since Spudnuts closed we've all been missing GOOD, LOCAL donuts. Well... here they are folks. Look no further. Great selection. Blueberry is really good. Also lemon lavender. Yum yum yum thank you!!

**be warned they don't have espresso machine so it's just drip coffee",25,5
Jb M.,06/07/21,,,,5,This place is friendly welcoming comfortable  with great food. They also know how to bake. We tried the Brioche loaf and the polenta-outstanding. We have gone back for breakfast and lunch-even the hamburgers were great. Tried smoked trout and various egg dishes and all were wonderful. We are waiting for them to have a dinner menu. In the meantime they have the nicest outside patio with a fire pit when needed.,12,
Molly R.,21/07/21,8,1,3,5,Delicious spot for breakfast or hanging with friends. The portions are huge too! We stopped in while in town but I could see myself here a lot if I lived in town. Lots of great outdoor seating too. The staff was wonderful too!,497,935
Lulu P.,07/08/21,,,1,3,I'm giving 3 stars for how nice it looks. They did a great job with the outside too-really pretty place but the sandwiches were awful. Both the Italian & the fried chicken sandwich were drenched in so much red sauce(siracha? Chipotle sauce?) that they were inedible. Also quite pricey-$14 each for counter pick up. The breakfast menu looked good but we had to toss our sandwiches-they were that bad. Maybe an off day for the chef? Or maybe we ordered the wrong things? Wanted to love it but instead we were irritated with the experience and we love good food!,42,1
Sara D.,10/08/21,,,,1,I've reviewed this cafe before with 5 stars. I was there this past Sunday and the customer service was absolutely horrible. It was half empty outside (meaning at least 6 empty tables were empty) I was asked to move to a smaller table because I was alone. Frankly as a paying customer it shouldn't matter if it's one of me or 5. I wanted to sit in the shaded area as it was noon. It's a shame. Also no espresso drinks. Just cold brew or drip coffee which is also a change. Overall don't plan on coming back. If you're solo don't even bother coming.,32,4
Abigail V.,16/08/21,,,,4,"This place was so charming! 

I saw a picture on Instagram of the sourdough cinnamon roll and I had to go! It did not disappoint. They offer donuts, pastries as well as a brunch menu! 

There is really pretty indoor and outdoor seating, such a sweet vibe! 

I would definitely recommend this place, but the only thing missing for me was additional coffee options.",79,26
Alison J.,17/08/21,,,1,4,"We had the number #2 BEC and the #3 avocado egg sandwiches, and a cold brew coffee and a drip coffee. The sandwiches were good - especially the bread which they make in-house. The size was almost too big but tasty - at least 3 eggs in each sandwich. The coffee was good too but wish they had an espresso machine! There was ample outdoor seating with some umbrellas. We were able to sit outdoors with our small dog. Next time I would try the avocado toast or a sandwich and one of their pastries.",77,230
Justin N.,26/08/21,1,1,5,5,"I came here for brunch with my friend. The inside was cute. And the food was amazing.

I tried the Cardamom Sugar Donut, the Breakfast Sandwich #2-- Bacon, Cheddar, Folded Egg, and Muffin, and the Belle Benedict with Lox. Everything I tasted was so good. The Cardamom Sugar Donut was fresh baked and yummy. The donut had a nice balance in flavor and was not too sweet.

The English muffins were fresh baked, soft, and delicious. The bacon and egg were cooked well, and the cheddar was nice and melted how I like it. 

The Belle Benedict with Lox was great. The bread was freshly baked and paired nicely with the runny egg to soak up the yolk. And the microgreen salad complimented the dish well to give it more freshness. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Belle. The restaurant was cute and lively during my Sunday brunch visit. And the freshly baked bread in the breakfast orders was amazing. In addition, the prices were reasonable, and the meal was fulfilling. It's definitely one of my new go-to brunch spots in the area and I can't wait to come back.",372,109
Aubrey W.,15/09/21,1,,1,5,"The cinnamon bun was by far the best I've ever had: not too sweet and very cinnamon forward. The dough almost had a hint of sourdough flavor, which I've never had in a cinnamon roll before but thoroughly enjoyed. I though the prices were a little on the steep side, but the food was so good that I couldn't give Belle any less than five stars. The homemade bread, especially the english muffins, brought my breakfast to the next level. I got breakfast sandwich #6. The combination of the sweetness of the jam (I believe it was apricot?) and the saltiness of the prosciutto created an amazing flavor profile. I added an egg, but I would recommend to just get the sandwich as is. The egg made it a little too messy and didn't add much flavor-wise. However, all the original components of the sandwich were delicious, and to top it all off it was served on a homemade english muffin! I also tried the avocado toast. Although the flavors were great, it was difficult to eat because the bread was so thick (and a little tough). I would definitely recommend trying a breakfast sandwich if you want a hearty, filling, and unique breakfast.",168,27
Jos O.,27/10/21,1,,1,5,"I got an egg sandwich on an English muffin with cheddar, sausage, and egg.
OMG, it was HUGE! And delicious. I could only eat half but the other half was still amazing later in the day. The muffins are gigantic, and it seemed like there were 2-3 eggs in this sandwich, and 3 slices of sharp cheddar. 
It was really really good. 
Yum!",56,186
Angelica D.,11/11/21,,,,3,Menu and spot is enticing. But the tea was low end grocery store. Cooks in kitchen were not wearing masks. Breakfast sandwich was very greasy and soggy. Perhaps better luck with other menu options.,13,3
Alison W.,17/11/21,3,,,4,"Such a nice brunch spot in Belmont - great atmosphere, wonderful service, delicious food, but subpar coffee. I got the #6 sandwich that consisted of prosciutto, gruyere cheese, and jam on a delicious homemade English muffin. All the ingredients were fresh and complemented each other wonderfully! The downside of the meal was the coffee that tasted watery and lacked flavor.",174,251
Neil S.,30/11/21,,,2,5,"As an unabashed lover of carbs and a gluten enthusiast, Belle's menu based on naturally leavened breads enthused me. My wife and I finally checked out this place during a recent Friday lunch, and our meal left us thoroughly impressed. 

We opted for Belle's take on an Italian hoagie for me and a eggplant-tahini sandwich for her. As a Philadelphian, I take my hoagies very seriously and have had many a disappointing sub during my time in the South. Belle's rendition tasted so good I nearly wept. The bread makes the sandwich, and Belle's hoagie roll could go toe-to-toe with the best rendition I've had in Philly and elsewhere. The quality Italian cold cuts, zippy pepper relish, and crisp lettuce and tomato made for a bite that reminded me of home and satisfied immensely. 

While I'm partial to the hoagie for sentimental reasons, my wife's eggplant sandwich tasted equally good. Hers arrived on crispy yet fluffy focaccia paired smartly with meaty eggplant, chopped eggs, and creamy potato chunks tossed in a deliciously verdant tahini sauce. The sandwich was incredibly messy but offered a punch of flavor on, of course, awesome bread. We ended with a sweet treat in Belle's sourdough cinnamon roll. The roll itself was not too sweet and the sour kick from the ferment played well with the sugary glaze. The base bread was moist and chewy, and thus represented a big improvement from most of the cinnamon rolls we tried prior.

The carb feast sat well in our stomachs, a testament to the slow, natural fermentation this place specializes in. My wife and I left this place full and yet eager to return and explore more of the menu. If you're in the mood for sandwiches or quality bread/baked goods, Belle should be your next stop.",480,116
Paige H.,16/02/22,1,,1,5,"Belle is by far the best bakery in town. Their food is always delicious (but a bit greasy so be warned) and the overall environment is really one of a local foodies haven. There is everything from food, to dessert, to wine and a perfect ambiance to either relax with friends, work on a project, or just read a book in a quiet corner. 

I am regularly asked to bring cinnamon rolls to work events in DC when I head up. If you haven't tried their delicious (and enormous) cinnamon rolls, you're missing out!",69,40
E M.,23/03/22,,,,5,"Fresh, friendly and fun.  The sandwiches are delicious and everyone was so friendly. Love the outdoor seating and the area shops too.",11,
Valerie T.,01/04/22,1,,1,5,"Hands down the best pastries in town. No joke their cinnamon buns and donuts are the best I've ever had. They're sourdough and omggggg 
Their food is really good too. We are repeat customers.",11,212
Valerie C.,06/05/22,,,2,1,"Had a very bad experience at Belle the other day so unfortunately I will not be going back. I had been looking forward to trying this spot as I had heard great things. When the sandwich that I ordered came out, it was cold and the avocado it had on it tasted rotten (you know that unfortunate taste avocado has when it's just not right...). It also just had what tasted like a cold Sriracha chili sauce squirted all over it. 

I went up to the lady working the register and showed her my sandwich and explained that the avocado tasted rotten and would it be possible to get something different? She got a man from the kitchen who I assume was the manager and I repeated the predicament to him to which he just stared at me and replied blankly ""Well that's too bad,"" with no sense of sympathy, apology, or customer service. 

IMO, this is very poor management of a restaurant and I will not be going back and will not be recommending this place. There are too many cafés and bakeries in town to waste another brunch here.",29,514
Maria M.,24/05/22,,,,4,delicious donuts that are worth the trip for alone. music is a loud if you're trying to do work there though,7,
Jen S.,07/06/22,1,,1,4,"Here's a local spot that folks from out of town seek out too if they're lucky enough to know about it! Such a quaint area of Belmont within Cville and this bakery is known for sweet and savory treats. It doesn't open until 9a so not for the early risers but that's because they need time to bake all those goodies! I had a warm coffee along with the #1 which is the egg, sausage and cheese sandwich on a brioche bun. It was huge and I think I'd use a fork next time since it was falling all over the place but decadent. Definitely get your $$ worth!! The sausage patty was enormous and jam packed with seasoning, the egg was fluffy but I would have preferred a choice of cheese since I'm not a yellow cheese fan (you wouldn't be either if you ever visited Cabot Creamery in Vermont!). I'm saving the sweets and full breads for my next visit since they have donuts and additional sweet treats too!",272,236
Samantha L.,08/06/22,,,,5,"We were in town visiting our friends and they told us this was the best place for egg sandwiches and they were not wrong at all! I don't think I have ever raved about an egg breakfast sandwich til now!!

I got the #3 - avocado, egg, chili paste, iceberg and brioche and holy crap however they make their chili paste it MAKES the whole sandwich. Just so flavorful and delicious. My boyfriend got the #1 bodega without the sausage - american, folded egg, brioche and he said his was also really good!",72,11
Ed U.,26/06/22,,1,2,5,"One of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had and I've had a ton.  Also easily the best English muffin that had ever entered my mouth.  The food and ambiance here are 

Didn't take a point off, but WHY do you open at 9am??? It's late for me even though I'm here on vacation.  If I were a local I'd already be at my desk before I could get any of your delicious food.",32,284
Katie P.,26/06/22,,,2,3,"Update- Changed to 3 stars, as we were offered a genuine apology from the owner. 

If you want to have a nasty message written about you to describe what table to deliver your food, this place is for you. Despite the very nice aesthetic, good food, and outdoor seating, the front staff is incredibly unprofessional and rude. Despite their demeanor, our group chocked it up to being very busy, which was understandable. We placed our order and found a table outdoors. However, when our food was delivered to our table, our receipt described one person in our group as ""the little bitc* in the red crop top and purple shorts"" as the person to deliver the food to. Amazingly, the server set this receipt down directly in front of us in full view. We were shocked, as there was not any sort of confrontation or atypical interaction with the woman taking our order. Upon talking about this with the employee who wrote the message, she simply said ""okay"" and walked away. For a business with a photo of ""Rosie the Riveter"" on the wall, they surely do not know how to respect other women. We were incredibly disappointed, as the food was great and this place was only a short walk from where we were staying; however, we would never return.",2,
Caroline F.,08/07/22,1,,2,5,"Pricey... but worth it. The #5 breakfast sandwich (pork, pimento, pickle, English muffin) is enormous and delicious. Beware if you take it on the run as it is a huge, oily mess to eat. Still figuring out what the delicious green sauce is (someone please enlighten me). As for the baked goods, everything is sourdough-based which can be hit or miss for me. I'm not as big a fan of the famous cinnamon rolls as everyone else in cville, but the donuts are excellent--light and not too sweet. There is plenty of room to sit inside or on the patio but parking can be scarce.",326,330
Jennifer M.,22/07/22,,,1,5,I tried this place finally! Highly recommend for baked goods and breakfast sandwiches. Can't wait to try everything else. I also had a donut. I'm glad I did take out or I would have gotten another.  I ordered online at 10:00 am so I had no trouble getting in and out. I like not waiting.,111,4
Jerry B.,27/07/22,,,1,4,"Went there to hear a local indie artist and her group. Music was great, atmosphere out on the deck was nice. Drinks were cold. All in all a good visit.",51,37
Sue E.,31/07/22,,1,,3,"Overall, the food we tried was meh.  Chocolate and cinnamon donuts had an odd sour taste to them.  I got the #1 egg sandwich and enjoyed the sausage and homemade brioche but the egg was massive and very unseasoned.  The atmosphere was nice and the coffees were good - wish they had espresso drinks.",59,68
Becca V.,19/08/22,1,,,5,"I came to try the cinnamon rolls, which are very delicious. Lots of flavor, not just sweetness. The woman running the front is very nice and friendly and the place was bustling, so it must be pretty  popular.",10,
Brandon B.,24/09/22,,,,5,"I can't believe how good these breakfast sandwiches are. They must put drugs somewhere in there. 

Really. You take a bacon, egg, and cheese anywhere, and if Belle makes it, it's the most delicious thing. I don't get it, but I'll take it every weekend. 

Favorite thing on the menu is the #6 (prosciutto, jam, gruyere), add egg. Boom. Your whole day just got better with one bite of that flavor bomb. 

There is a bit of a wait, but I would stand in line for an hour for that #6.",220,10
Sonny G.,27/09/22,1,2,,4,I've been a handful of times since I've been in town and staff is very friendly - I don't love the clientele there (mostly an upper crust snobby vibe) but the food is delicious every time.,42,7
Katie S.,01/10/22,,,1,4,Great breakfast! Loved the avocado toast and the coffee. There was a good amount of outdoor seating.,13,31
Mark W.,03/11/22,,,,5,"Passing through the Charlottesville area I stayed nearby and needed something for breakfast. While the menu looked terrific, we needed a quick bite. The scones and doughnuts were dynamite and a cup of delicious coffee was the perfect start to the next leg of the trip.",64,
Karen R.,01/12/22,,,,4,"My sandwich #6 was excellent. The English muffin was unbelievably delicious, light and fluffy. My husband was not as pleased with his biscuit and gravy special. He said the biscuit was dry and the gravy thinner and blander than he likes. He prefers it very peppery. The cinnamon roll we shared was really good. My coffee was OK, sort of bitter. We will go back because there were other sandwiches we want to try.",98,
Laura M.,05/12/22,,,,4,"belle brunch  i was skeptical because this place took a while to figure out what there vibe was. weird hours, no espresso machine, etc. but when you hit them while their open, it's a gem! French toast, breakfast sandwiches, donuts are all sooo yummy. once a month (i think) they open on Friday nights for music and happy hour with a food truck and that is lovely too! a bit pricey but worth the trip.",95,811
Emily B.,09/02/23,2,1,1,4,The food was great! All of their bread is fresh baked so I would recommend their sandwiches. We also ran into their local egg vendor who delivers farm fresh ingredients! The omelet was like nothing I've ever seen before. I would definitely recommend going on a day where you can sit in the outdoor seating and soak in the sun with your meal. My only complaint is that the food took long with only one person in the kitchen on a Wednesday and they weren't able to heat up the focaccia bread I'd ordered in the restaurant. I love that the place is dog friendly though!!!,246,109
Claire K.,15/04/23,,,,5,"The staff members are lovely, and the environment is great for eating outside. And Belle's fried artichoke sandwich was a revelation! I've become obsessed.",31,
Song R.,22/05/23,,,,5,"It's hard to find a good French toast!! Quite often they are beautifully grilled on the outside, only to cut into what turns out to be just dry or flavorless bread.

If you are craving really yummy French toast, made the way it's supposed to be made, moist and flavorful, this is the place to go on Sundays for brunch!!! No really!! The scrabbled eggs, bacon and side salad were equally delicious.

Belle puts love into making food, especially their sourdough breads!

Bravo Belle!!!",32,
Andrew G.,23/05/23,,,,5,"What a gem of a place with some of the best bread and most inventive sandwiches I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Stopping here on my way for a quick breakfast with my group, the service was not only fast, but very accommodating for a carry out order. Rarely do I get paralyzed by choice, but what caught my eye was the smoked whitefish sandwich on brioche and I am SO glad I went with this piece of art. The whitefish was salty and tangy slathered all over the buttery and perfectly toasted brioche. Companions of mine got some donuts and bread as well and WOW - I seriously couldn't get over the donuts and the bread we shared was soft, chewy and didn't even need butter. The cold brew paired so perfectly with our whole meal, and couldn't resist an extra picture out front.",618,535
Sanni M.,27/05/23,,,,5,"We live in Richmond, but go here whenever we come to Charlottesville. The sandwiches are soooo fresh and delicious! And the outside seating is great!",8,
Taylor S.,07/06/23,,,,5,"Bagel & salmon with scallion cream cheese, capers, and red onion was out of this world! Also enjoyed a sourdough strawberry glazed donut which was also amazing. Will definitely be back next time passing through Charlottesville!",10,153
Caryn K.,14/08/23,,,,5,"We stumbled upon this gem of a brunch spot while in Charlottesville for a bachelorette trip and it was fabulous! They were quite busy when we arrived, but they were constantly restocking their case of pastries. There was a little bit of a wait on the coffee but the food was relatively quick considering how busy it was. They have indoor and outdoor seating and a nice variety on the menu. I had potentially, the best breakfast sammie of my life, while at Belle. The picture I took, does it absolutely no justice, but I did include it in the review. I ordered the #1 with cheddar and my sister ordered the #6 (at least I think that is what she ordered). My breakfast sammie was filled with generous helpings of sausage and egg. The cheese wasn't overdone and the bread made it feel like I was almost eating a burger. It was a 10/10 experience. If I find myself back in Charlottesville, I will have to come back here bc the food was that great!",173,127
Jon H.,28/08/23,,,,5,Charlottesville's simple and elegant healthy breakfast. Try the American breakfast or the Cubano for lunch. Beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff.,2,
Susan K.,05/09/23,1,,1,4,"Heavenly smell of cinnamon walking through the door. Service was walk up, ample seating, friendly staff.  Food was just good, a bit under seasoned and no salt or pepper shakers.  Coffee is why I deducted a star.  Bitter and tastes like chicory.  I put in loads of 1/2 & 1/2 and still threw out half a cup.  Hubby felt the same.",240,100
Jia Yang C.,08/09/23,1,1,1,3,"Came here for brunch and the staff were really friendly and nice and atmosphere was great. The restaurant itself is a really cool old-school vibe to it. I got the #1 sando and it came out to be just over $13 and I think it was good but nothing special, especially for $13.",3,3
Ryan K.,11/09/23,1,,1,5,"Good breakfast food! We visited Belle on an early Sunday afternoon, and it was busy, but we managed to find a table. Belle only takes reservations for dinner and not for breakfast. Another note to keep in mind is that they do not serve their sandwiches on Sundays. Patrons seat themselves and order near the front of the restaurant. There was no music playing (that I could tell), but it was difficult to hear my partner because of the noise generated by the surrounding patrons. I ordered the Belle mushroom and Gruyere omelette. The food was served in under 10 minutes after our order. This omelette was one of the best I have ever tried. The egg was perfectly cooked, and the balance of flavors was excellent. Overall, I would recommend Belle for a fast Sunday breakfast.",674,21
Sam C.,23/09/23,,,1,5,"Best breakfast sandwiches in town, healthy delicious unique sourdough donuts, amazing barista and coffee selections. Awesome crew too. New tables outside are upgrades.",47,65

Elizabeth M.,24/12/23,,,,5,So cute and has amazing breakfast & sandwiches. Great place to bring friends and family visiting town.,8,
Ulgonda K.,28/12/23,1,1,1,3,"Far too expensive for what you get. $15 for a turkey sandwich, seriously! That's just for a sandwich, no side. Seems arrogant. Speaking of the sandwich, it was slopped up with multiple sauces and dripped all over the place. I didn't finish the second half because it was so sloppy and squishy. My partner's sandwich was burnt, but he powered through. My daughter said the avocado toast was fine, but she was hungry within a couple hours. 
Bottom line- too much money for too little food that is very OK. Would not go back.",146,40
Margaret Alora N.,01/01/24,,,1,5,"You can't go wrong with Belle. It's a beautiful little unassuming space with comfortable seating indoors and out. Charlottesville's finest. 

Love the fresh sourdough, English muffins, avocado toast, cinnamon rolls. Doughnuts! Dinner service--equally amazing.",16,89
Jorge I.,04/02/24,2,,2,4,A super cute and simple spot! Bakery and coffee shop by day and resto-bar by night. The sourdough cinnamon roll was absolutely delicious and our chai tea latte was even better.,114,27
Jennifer M.,18/02/24,,,,3,"A frustrating night and not sure we'd go back. We had a reservation for 6:45pm.  We arrive and are told our table isn't ready because the party ahead of us are lingering. . No problem. The hostess/waitress comes around to take our drink order and we hang out.  30 minutes later we are seated but still haven't received our drinks.  And we're seated at a table for 8 even though our reservation is for 10 people.  Two people in our group are late so we've ordered appetizers and they order drinks and appetizers.  All our appetizers come and our drinks finally arrive 45 min after we got there  minus our friends who are late drinks.  

We put in our dinner orders and another round of drinks.  Our friends still haven't received their first drinks.  

Our dinners come and our friends still don't have their drinks.  The bartender has no clue. An hour after our friends ordered their drinks they finally get their drinks AFTER THEY ASKED where they were.   It was clear their drink order hadn't been put in or the bartender didn't see it.  

I really enjoyed our Brussel sprouts appetizer and sourdough bread appetizer.  We got the steak frites and it was fine. Nothing to write home about.  Half our party got the butternut squash risotto and there was zero butternut squash in it and the truffle was overwhelming.  Our entire table smelled like truffle oil.  

It took forever to get drink orders. Even though it's a small restaurant it was clear that the bartender could not keep up with the service. They probably need a second bartender. 

All in all it was meh.  Honestly I don't think we'd go back.

Belle is open for dinner Wed-Sat.",165,26
Chloe N.,12/03/24,1,,,5,"Okay, I want to start by saying we drove an hour off route on an 11 hour trip just to eat this sandwich again.

I'm from PA, where pizza shops are abundant and subs with fresh baked bread are top notch. Italian subs are one of my absolute favorite delights.

Now, when I say the Italian sandwich at Belle is stellar, I cannot under emphasize the authenticity of this classic. It's an iconic replication of the standard with class, tact and intention. The sourdough roll/mini baguette is out of this world soft with a nice toasty crust. 

It seems like the meat is sourced ethically, but maybe I'm making that up for the sake of my own pretentious nature. Then, the hunk of real mozzarella is a delicious touch of mouth watering fat. Top it with the thin sliced reds and a balanced mix of Mayo / oil / vin and pepper relish?! AYFKM?! 

Pair it with a Mexican Coke and you have an ""elevated staple"". There I go with the pretentiousness again 

I want to also acknowledge the incredible staff who made accommodations for us driving a long distance and running really close to closing time. 

Make sure you get the English muffins, doughnuts, cinnamon rolls... whatever is in the sourdough bakery case, for your mornings after.

This place is a true gem and I commend the hearts behind this HEARTH!!!",71,
Desiree J.,03/04/24,,,,4,"Fast and friendly service. I ordered the cinnamon doughnut with an iced chai latte and my husband ordered a hot mocha with a cinnamon roll. My iced chai was very good, it actually tasted like chai and not just milk. I thought my doughnut would be hotter than room temp due to cut coming right when it opened but it was just room temp. Overall it was good experience",29,116
Courtney T.,06/04/24,,1,,3,"Not sure how I felt about this spot. Went on a Saturday around 12:15pm. They only do their brunch menu on Sunday fyi, but not an issue. I ordered the #6: prosciutto cotto, Gruyère, and I added an egg. For $15, I was rather disappointed: the sandwich was fine but the cheese wasn't melted and prosciutto cotto was almost over powering. 

$15 for one sandwich with nothing on the side is a bit crazy in my opinion, unless it's an amazing sandwich. Plentiful indoor and outdoor seating, friendly staff. Be prepared to wait a little bit for food, I think I ended up waiting about 20 minutes for my sandwich. And parking lot/street parking is park mobile- not sure how often it's enforced.",227,8
Melissa P.,17/04/24,,,,5,"My husband and I happened upon this amazing place over the weekend. We were enjoying a few days of much deserved ""R&R"" in Charlottesville VA. While searching for somewhere to have breakfast we found Belmont Belle. From the moment I walked inside I knew Belle would not disappoint. My husband ordered a Croquet Monsieur Tartine sandwich and  I an omelette made with Gruyère cheese and mushrooms. Belmont Belle bakes their  own breads and pastries which I can personally attest are beyond delicious. The service was quite good considering how many people were waiting to get a table either inside or out. The ambience is so cozy and inviting.  
Belmont Belle is a one of a kind little gem that should not be missed by all who visit Charlottesville!",35,
Yelp Y.,20/04/24,,,,3,"Coffee was great. Food not so much. Fun friendly environment with some organizational issues.

Cole M.,08/06/24,,,,4,"This was a very good but unspectacular sandwich. I would definitely recommend giving this place a shot as the prices were fairly reasonable. And the food is incredible fresh. I will definitely go back to try other sandwiches and update this review accordingly.

Unfortunately I messed up and did not try their coffee (which by the looks of the ones I saw may have moved the needle a little bit more).",140,24

From the Anjou 75cocktail to the Comte and Epoisses with accompaniment's.  followed by delicious, perfectly cooked delicate flounder, inventive homemade pasta and lighter modern take on beef bourguignon we were so happy with our choice.  The clafoutis dessert was the perfect finishing touch! Everything we had Over the top delicious and all  with  unique touches ! Easily the best restaurant meal I have had in months!",11,

The menu has some great brunch options. I got the special (see pic) and #5. The eggs are incredibly fluffy. 

You have to get a cinnamon roll! We also got a cardamom donut, which was subtle and unique.

Unfortunately, service was very spotty. There were weird gaps in getting our food. Also, the French toast was obviously burnt.

I'm keeping at 4 stars for the chill vibe and great menu options. My flat white was also on point.",5405,3515

There are a bunch of tables both inside and out depending on temperature. It's a good place to grab a bite and chat.

Breakfast options look good; plan to try in the future!",362,173

We swung in for a quick brekky and coffee fix. You order at the bar, we got the Croque Madam and one of the breakfast sandwiches along with a nutella empanada of sorts that was delicious! 
Very popular (for gppd reason) and we happened to get lucky when coming in there was an available spot to sit (late morning, week day) - id say be prepared to wait on a weekend 
Parking was limited in the lot but street parking was easy to find :)",3,
Tom S.,15/12/24,,,,5,"Incredible rehearsal dinner and welcome party for Colleen and Michael at @bellecville last week.  
Combine the delicious food - from the poached lobster and quail/pork belly first courses to the trout almondine or ribeye filet mains - with the french bistro ambience and a  room full of family and friends, and you get one amazing party.  
John Shanesy's creative cuisine was on full display from a simple compound butter that we were still dipping our fingers into long after the bread was inhaled to the carrot cake that none of us had room for, but all of us ate.  Then, when none of us could even eat a thin mint, the welcome party started and Brooke's signature charcuterie board came out (setting a new standard for what a charcuterie board is supposed to be!) 
Incredible service and too many Whiskey Cider Smashes made for a memorable evening that kicked off the wedding weekend right.",3,
Tanya Z.,20/12/24,,,1,4,"A deliciously sublime meal at Belle. Starting with appetizers, including a cheese board with Comte, Bleu d'Auvergne, and Epoussis with assorted breads, carrot salad in vinaigrette, tartare filet with focaccia, and escargot (this one not sampled by yours truly). This was followed by tender beef bourguignon and glazed carrots. Finally, although we were full, we managed to squeeze in sharing two cherry clafoutis with ice cream. It reminded me of a Dutch pancake with custard--not heavy, and the tartness of the cherries provided a nice complement to the vanilla flavors.

The space was cozy and warm, and our server was excellent.",23,
