David H.,11/19/16 22:38,1,0,0,1,4,"Lampo was nice, probably the best pizza you'll find in Charlottesville. The space is so small which is why there's always a wait - they do have tables outside if it's a nice day. We tried a couple cheeses and meats from the charcuterie menu, nothing out of the ordinary, but prices were good at $3/serving. For entrees, we went with the mushroom pizza and the porchetta sandwich. The pizza was ok - crust was a little too doughy for me, and I wish the pizza had more garlic and less cream. Mushrooms were good and had great texture. The sandwich was pretty good - the porchetta was tasty, but there was too much broccoli rabe which overpowered if you got the wrong bite. Also, wish the bread would've been thicker as the sandwich fell apart it was so messy. The bread though was also really good, cooked in the wood burning pizza oven. 

Overall a nice place for a meal, but I wouldn't wait more than 20-30 minutes. We got lucky and were seated immediately",2022,385,LHsCa_aVta4UbbrcL4hE5A,"Washington, DC",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LHsCa_aVta4UbbrcL4hE5A,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/DXLc0glYOKpcuOG-I4rmJA/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Onvara A.,5/10/17 19:14,1,0,0,1,5,"I don't typically like eating pizza, but Lampo's Funghi pizza is my absolute favorite! It has  pioppini and oyster mushrooms, garlic, cream, provolone, and grana padano. I've ordered this every time I've come because it's just so good.

I've also tried their Cavoletti di Bruxelles, which is shaved brussels sprouts with chives, fennel, roasted hazelnuts, maple garum vinaigrette, pecorino. I was a bit disappointed with this because I thought the brussels sprouts would be cooked and warm, but it wasn't.

I would still wholeheartedly recommend Lampo though! There's also a parking lot in the back which is amazing for the Belmont area. Come on a weekday to avoid the crowd.",619,41,x_Frpa8QWc25FDJ5BJM8tg,"Clayton, NC",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=x_Frpa8QWc25FDJ5BJM8tg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/evNRftPdoOCNPJ5MzyyMAw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Aarti B.,1/23/18 6:25,1,1,1,2,4,"Nice neapolitan pizza and cinnamon fried donuts. Reminds me of the cozy restaurants in Manhattan that gets packed! Don't bother to book a reservation as Lampo doesn't take one. 

My fiancee took me here on my birthday at 5pm on Saturday and we had to wait for over 50 minutes. We first waited in the hall and ordered a drink, and then we finally made it over to the ""waiting"" room in the back, where we ordered another drink. The wait wasn't so bad as the cocktails really sweetened the deal. I really liked the Lampo Smash, the Hot Toddy wasn't my favorite. 

When we finally ordered, we got the classic neapolitan pizza, special salad, and fried donuts to top it off. 

The special salad had bold flavors with nutty farro, mozzarella cheese, pumpkin seeds, and pomegranate seeds. An eclectic combination that works well.  

The pizza was cooked well, but the best part of the meal was the cinnamon fried donuts. It really reminded me of funnel cake. I gobbled up all of the donuts and left one for my fiancee when he got back from the rest room (at least I left one!). 

Overall, I had a nice birthday meal and can understand the 4.5 - 5 star rating, but not sure if I would come back given the long wait for just pizza.",1315,907,gljACJz-NQqyDTTYUOU0lA,"McLean, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gljACJz-NQqyDTTYUOU0lA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/BXKOiy1HAnzKDDSErB15eg/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Ziv H.,9/9/18 13:11,1,0,0,2,5,"A proper Italian thin pizza- Neopolitan, Florentine, etc. Reminds me of the pizza I ate, knife and fork, in a small shop in Naples. Or the made-to-measure pizzas I ate three nights in a row at the San Lorenzo Market in Florence.

Thin crisp crust. A delivery vehicle for ingredients above. Anchovies floating on a briny sea of capery oil and light cheese and tomatoes. I'm a sucker for the hairy fish, and all umami. But the rest of the pizzas look equally fab. 

Start with a bowl of olives, some blue cheese and salami and plan your assault.

Alas, Lampo has been long 'discovered' so it's best to arrive at an off-hour, a blistering hot day, or with a bag of patience.

Don't settle for eating a cardboard box and blurry orange sauce, er PapaJ.

Melissa Z.,10/4/18 21:38,1,1,1,2,4,"If you're looking for a Neopolitan pizza place in Charlottesville, this is it. You can tell each dish is made with fresh ingredients and has a lot of thought put into them - the dishes are simple but with complex flavors. I'd recommend the Prosciutto pizza personally. 1 pizza can be shared between two people with an appetizer. Very reasonably priced but with a fancier feel. The only thing I would say is you can't make reservations so be prepared to wait if you're going on a weekend.",303,493,mHNtArKcW30P0zaxDOxtng,"Arlington, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mHNtArKcW30P0zaxDOxtng,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Mdh1tXbuHqBV8ZbxPyrXWA/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Mike S.,11/11/18 14:53,2,0,0,1,5,"I'm just going to say it. This is the best pizza I've ever had that wasn't in Italy or Brooklyn. The two places I consider the Mecca of pizza in US and Overseas. 

So, I think this place is amazing. Plain and simple. The pizzas were perfect in every way. This WILL be my MUST stop places whenever in C'ville for work. Thought the scissors were going to be a turn off, but I now love pizza scissors. 

Side note, saw someone order a chop of some sort and it was massive and looked like the best hunk of meat I've ever scene at a mainly pizza spot. Also, they have a real deal Italian stove that takes up the whole center of the restaurant. It's the amount of care to detail and perfection that makes this place amazing.",671,395,x3133lbPRsll8t2lrZeApw,"Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, NY",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=x3133lbPRsll8t2lrZeApw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/fbuxvgHVobm7N1Lt8eFzjg/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
William L.,1/11/19 5:14,2,0,0,1,5,"Pizza was excellent.  Despite what you might think from the menu, the flavors were subtle and perfectly balanced.  The scissors were useful part of the flatware for both solo diners and groups.  

Service is first-rate, and the bartender knows what she was doing,  The escarole the start of the meal was delicious, a nice green opener for the brown and tan main event.  Bar offers lots of cocktail options.

Lori W.,2/16/19 21:58,0,0,0,1,5,"Still no Howie Long or David Baldacci sightings...can only hope!
Returned here after our first visit here last year. We were thrilled to return. Jackpot: only had to wait 15 minutes - late lunch. 

Mary: great server. Smiling, helpful and truly nice.
Brussel spouts: shaved, with hazelnuts, garlic and only $5!
Pizza: the Funghi - with ricotta cheese it whips everything into a perfect pie. that charred crust. We asked for the chili oil to spice it up - outstanding.
Wine: two glasses of white - the Pinot Grigio was very reasonably priced at $9. Perfect temp too.

LOVE this place.",796,137,hyJusnslNlSLflrThs-54w,"Alexandria, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hyJusnslNlSLflrThs-54w,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/0lVtd6HQRaQHNQUD5YhQVw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Audrey O.,4/5/19 17:24,0,0,0,0,5,"Just went with a friend late at 9pm on a Thursday. Waited 20 minutes for a table, and was served our drinks outside. We ordered the meatballs and The Buffalo Mozzarella and Prosciutto to start. For the main we shared the Funghi and Margherita pizzas. 

Highlights: The Buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto were to die for! The meatballs were very good as well with a nicely ground texture. The Funghi pizza was my favorite thanks to the garlicky panna cotta base. While it definitely wasn't the ~best~ Neapolitan pizza I have had, it is for sure the best pizza i have had in Charlottesville. 

The service was prompt, accommodating for allergies, and the timing of the courses was perfect. 

Will definitely return if I can!",142,125,RNsUbAtPOBkinbFezBoKXQ,"Denver, CO",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RNsUbAtPOBkinbFezBoKXQ,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/g2qtbIK7RQfbZsXB9cA8YQ/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Zhana E.,4/12/19 21:32,4,0,0,3,5,"Easily one of my favorite restaurants here in Charlottesville. I am a pizza fanatic and this place is at the top of my list. Their pizza is amazing and I LOVE the crust on their pizza. All of their ingredients taste very fresh. Normally I visit this place for dinner, they are always packed and I often have to wait either outside or in the small room in the back. The waiting time always varies so either get there when they first open or be prepared to wait. They always offer wine or drinks while you wait. When you sit down the food normally comes out pretty fast and the staff are really friendly and accomodating. The best part of this place are the pizza scissors! If you want to try Lampo with no wait, I went yesterday (Thursday) for lunch and we got a table right away and the service was fast again!",114,186,3YN4ezjawVFZhux8NRhEIQ,"Charlotte, NC",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3YN4ezjawVFZhux8NRhEIQ,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/qOUKaJToAOqH0_KC7afvSA/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Ana D.,5/3/19 12:23,0,2,2,1,4,"So I can't speak to the pizza yet because when I came I was doing the keto diet so no pizza BUT I can say that it looked and smelled delicious. I do plan on coming back eventually to try to pizza. With that said, there were actually plenty of things in the menu that were keto friendly. I got a plate of different spreads which included fresh mozzarella, three year Parmesan, and some meats. 
I found it very filling. 
The wait was lonnnng. Not sure if they take reservations. 
When it's a nice day, sitting outside is ideal. 
Plenty of doggies outside. One of them was playing with a stick/root that was buried in the ground. The reason why I'm mentioning this is because I actually ended up tripping on it on our way to sit down later. So if someone from the restaurant reads this... you guys should probably make sure that there aren't any trip hazards for your patrons outside because someone could get hurt.",280,235,EM6TVH3AOAPZk8PR4HFKIA,"New York, NY",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EM6TVH3AOAPZk8PR4HFKIA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/yj3APcp0o7mI66o-h-SrKw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Kong L.,5/9/19 14:47,1,0,0,1,3,"We arrived on a Saturday night around 8:00 p.m. We were lucky enough to park right in front of the restaurant, although parking was very limited. We put our name on the list and waited exactly an hour for a table for 2 -- we ended up sitting at the bar for 2. We sipped on some cider next door as we waited. Was it worth the wait for the experience? To be honest, it was not worth the one hour wait. The food came out at a good pace. We ordered the meatballs to kick off the meal. It was delicious with a nice texture. I really enjoyed the portion of the meal. We topped it off with the clam pizza. It was ok, nothing special about it. The customer service was great. Our waitress was very kind. 

If you're craving pizza and want the Neapolitan pizza experience; not a bad place to stop by if you're willing to wait.",1425,448,NQOJtfBfQ7FNENtJuXJLYw,"Chapel Hill, NC",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NQOJtfBfQ7FNENtJuXJLYw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/SVm4AQ50NgfuoRuB5FnCGw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Ashley H.,5/15/19 20:51,0,0,0,0,5,"Lampo is definitely my favorite pizza place in Charlottesville. The pizza is Neapolitan style so you cut your own slices with scissors provided which is super fun! I would definitely recommend the fungi pizza, Brussels sprouts, and buffalo mozzarella. My friends really enjoy the hell boy pizza, however while I found it to be good it was also a little bit greasy for my taste. The place is small so seating can be hard to find during the dinner rush so I would recommend coming at lunch time when it's less crowded.",158,303,p5i6MBJFKJS6EGybvjYDpQ,"Fairfax Station, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=p5i6MBJFKJS6EGybvjYDpQ,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dPFllNVp74gRpiZZlBeHjQ/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Caroline F.,5/17/19 3:19,0,1,1,1,5,"Best pizza in town. Have tried most of the pizzas and the funghi is probably my favorite, with the Diavola as a close second. Loved the flavors of the Hellboy (a special), but it was a bit soggy due to the honey or oil. The cheese slid straight off! Brussels sprouts salad is a must, and meatballs app if you're not getting a meat pizza. Go for lunch and you might not have to wait!",326,330,jRKRjL0ySh3G7nEiWnPFhA,"Charlottesville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jRKRjL0ySh3G7nEiWnPFhA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/0nThyA6AF4hoEuXE1HhkQw/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Jeeyeon M.,5/20/19 4:40,1,0,0,1,5,"I've been to lampo a few times over the past few months and they never disappoint! The water buffalo mozzarella was served with warm bread and a drizzle of olive oil and was light but still flavorful. The funghi pizza is my personal favorite, but the vongole pizza was the winner this time. I highly recommend getting both! Prosciutto was a little too salty for my taste. Abruzzo pizza is basically margherita with some meatballs on top and is a safe choice if you don't like venturing out of your comfort zone too much. 
I recommend getting there near opening time if possible, as they don't take reservations and do it by a paper waitlist! Sometimes they'll let you stand on the side and snag the bar seats if the waitlist party doesn't show up.",44,483,VOE64d6MBjBv7WwReYo0JA,"Deerwood, Charlottesville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=VOE64d6MBjBv7WwReYo0JA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/V6ht4lOZbUasg8g83aT74A/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Casey S.,6/11/19 1:36,0,0,0,0,5,"Lampo is a Charlottesville icon! It's renowned for it's small menu of Italian appetizers and pizzas that are famously served with kitchen shears to literally cut your pizza into slices yourself. The pizza itself is another story: crust is perfectly crisp and hot, olive oil base or housemade marinara flavorful, and the various toppings and cheeses perfectly balanced and crafted for a delicious ensemble. the prosciutto with the lemony arugula and garlic and olive oil blew my mind. we had no leftovers to take home!

You can't make reservations here, but if there's a wait at dinner, it's well worth it. There's a full bar for a quick drink or glass of wine if you want to wait inside. The restaurant itself is small, but in a cozy and intimate setting reminiscent of family places and hole-in-the-wall dining in Europe itself.",183,371,qdtA5TTtueNZZRNo28Ytig,"Arlington, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qdtA5TTtueNZZRNo28Ytig,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/_M1tL0c4wYqD7gHSQ-TVyg/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Sally H.,6/14/19 1:41,1,1,1,0,4,"Went on a Thursday night about 6:30, in summer, and had a 45 minute wait to be seated. This is the first reality of Lampo: you will wait. They have a tiny interior seating space, with several tables on a covered patio outside. The staff pumps out food and drink as fast as possible, but in this location, it still means waiting. I do not want to imagine the wait time on a Friday night when the university is in full swing. 
Was the food worth it? Yes. My 2 companions and I enjoyed salads, olives, drinks and two 12 inch pizzas that we completely demolished, the Abruzzo (with meatballs) and the Prosciutto (with arugula and prosciutto toppings). There was some heated discussion about who got the last piece! 
So. Go, wait, then enjoy. A good place for a wonderful pizza dinner.",312,67,WIDh6WFxYgdrXsl21pu2Bw,"Kalamazoo, MI",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WIDh6WFxYgdrXsl21pu2Bw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/fnFtu-6jlE4uTefBzF-hcg/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Connie L.,9/29/19 16:59,1,0,0,2,5,"The pizza here was amaaazing. I was working in the area for several weeks in a row during the summer of 2019, and my boss said I absolutely had to stop by here before I left. I almost didn't come because I was really intimidated by how small the space seemed to be and the lack of reservations, but I decided to take advantage of the fact that I was around on weeknights when the restaurant would (theoretically) be less packed.

I arrived at just before 7:30 PM on a Thursday evening, and the restaurant was very, very busy. I was seated immediately at the bar because I was dining solo and they happened to have that odd seat available, but if I had been in a group or even a couple, I would've had to wait. The restaurant is definitely very small and cramped, tables and bar seating included. Since I'm really petite, I would describe it as cozy, but I imagine anyone bigger than me might say it was uncomfortable. My end of the bar was also where the bartender set the drinks before the servers came around to take them out; I had a small space to set my wallet/pocketbook next to it. I was afraid it might be in the way, but no one said anything and all the staff seemed very adept at working in the small space.

I decided to order the pizza special of the day, which was a pizza with white anchovies and capers. It took a little while for the pizza to come out, but not unexpected given they were being made to order and the place was absolutely heaving. While I waited for my food, I had a very close view of the kitchen and was able to watch the kitchen staff very diligently stretch dough, sprinkle cheese on various orders, and load up their huge pizza oven. I felt like the huge pizza oven really added to the rustic and ""authentic"" atmosphere of the restaurant. It was also the star of the kitchen; everything from pizzas to meatball appetizers went in there.

I was so happy when my pizza came out, along with the ""scizzas"" to cut it up. The pizza was definitely one of my favorite things I ate during my time in Charlottesville. I've had pizzas in both Rome and small villages in Italy, and I would honestly say Lampo held its own even when compared to those. The anchovy and capers were super flavorful and the amazing dough complimented the toppings beautifully. I definitely inhaled my pizza because I didn't eat lunch in preparation for pigging out, but the portions are large enough that you could reasonably expect to take part of the pizza home with you, especially if you have appetizers to start.

For dessert, I was torn between the budino (chocolate pudding) and the zeppole (ricotta doughnuts). Normally, I think I would go for the zeppole because I'm a carb monster, and they looked very attractive when some of the tables around me ordered them. But I decided to go for the budino since it was more unique compared to my normal dessert options and I wanted to try something new. The pudding was delicious and the hazelnut brittle added a lovely texture. It was served with a layer of olive oil drizzled on top--I can't honestly say it added much to the flavor or texture of the dessert in my opinion, but I definitely wasn't against it.

The bartender was super friendly and quick to refill my water throughout the meal. At one point during the meal, one of the kitchen staff caught me making eyes at the pizza oven and seemed amused; he also asked how I liked my food after I'd finished my pizza. Everyone seemed very quick and efficient. For the quality of the food, I thought the prices were reasonable; this meal wound up being one of my pricier ones during my stay in Charlottesville, but I did get a lot of extras (dessert, a cappuccino), and I think if you came for just pizza, $16 for the size and quality of the pizza is really reasonable.

My experience might be helped by the fact that I didn't have to wait for a seat, but now that I've tasted the food, I think a 45-minute wait would've been worth it to me. I think that's something to be prepared for if you're coming here in the evenings, even during the week. When I left the restaurant around 8:30 PM, it was dark out, and couples were still putting their names down to be seated. The restaurant and its environs aren't much to look at from the outside, but the atmosphere is so warm and bustling on the inside. (If you don't like cramped seating or get claustrophobic easily, this might not be the place for you.)",527,234,sB0UxWOQymWc_UH82lfN7Q,"Tysons Corner, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sB0UxWOQymWc_UH82lfN7Q,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/7Sg08Y1kQoQEvwT3S8tSCA/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Mia W.,1/4/20 19:25,1,0,0,0,5,"5 stars all around. The atmosphere was my favorite in Charlottesville so far. Very intimate environment with about 6 tables and a bar that seats around 8-10. The lighting is low and the mood is super chill. I was there with my daughter on a Tuesday night around 9 and they were busy but no wait. It has the feel of a neighborhood spot  and the food was rustic and delicious. 

We had the clam pizza and the shaved Brussel sprout salad. Both were made to perfection  and very filling. The pricing is perfect (pizzas 12-18 dollars and enough for two) and the experience was made complete with bread and a glass of wine!

Kalpana S.,1/11/20 16:12,2,0,0,1,5,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlottesville! Having been to Naples and eaten margarita pizza there, I have to say Lampo has excellent Neapolitan pizza. There is always a wait here and they do not take reservations, so come early! I do appreciate that they serve cocktails to the waiting customers, which really helps distract you from the wait. It is definitely worth the wait! The service is great. Even though they are busy you don't feel like they are rushing you to clear the table. 

They import their ingredients from Italy, which I'm sure adds to the authenticity of the food. Everything I've tried here has been amazing.

We ordered bread and meatballs for an appetizer, and liked them both- actually the meatballs(you get 6-) would be a good light entree, I might just get that next time!!

We ordered the mushroom pizza, the margherita pizza, and the hell-boy. All were great-I really loved the mushroom one!! And also the margarita one!!

Edward M.,3/27/20 1:18,0,0,0,1,4,"Overall Lampo is pretty good.

The menu is pretty limited but the pizza is good and the wines are decent.
Yeah they charge you for just ok bread and that's mildly irritating.
The olives are a pretty good app.

I've had 2 of the desserts and both are good, as is the cappuccino.

The place is nice inside but very small and crowded every night of the week. 
So expect to wait even on a Monday or Tuesday night.

The downside is that it's pretty expensive. When I'm there on business by myself I can easily spend $60-$70, which seems like a lot for basically pizza. 

Service is good and I can usually find a parking spot somewhere not too far away. 

Overall I recommend the place, especially when my company is footing the bill.",279,71,XHSMF8NUQuT1LZ44jTpQPA,"Cheshire, CT",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=XHSMF8NUQuT1LZ44jTpQPA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/1Lc5FUCpszxtGnQjZZY_ow/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
Kevin W.,4/7/20 17:10,3,0,0,2,5,"Great place to eat and enjoy drinks. We have been to lampo on multiple occasions to enjoy the hype, a recommendation that was well worth it on our initial visit.

Everything that we have eaten here was tasty and fresh, well prepared and done perfectly. My personal favorite on the menu - The Hellboy pizza. I can not get enough and it seems to get better every time I order it. Hard to believe something so freaking good can get better!!! We seriously have almost eaten the entire menu, hard to find a dish that is not pleasing.

The staff at Lampo are pretty cool and on point, delivering nothing but stellar service. Warning, there can be a wait since this place is known for its quality (but it's well worth it). On the day that we initially visited we probably waited 15-20 minutes to get a table, which didn't seem long to us and we were lucky to get in that quickly (Dinner rush).  Once seated the food and drinks rolled out not soon after ordering.

The restaurant is pretty clean, cozy and compact on the inside with additional seating on the outside. Definitely worth multiple visits and check out their wood fired oven!!

Patrick P.,7/20/20 3:38,1,2,2,1,5,"I don't think no less than three people, none of whom live in C'ville, told me that I had to get a pie at Lampo. I was told it may be the best pizza I'll ever had. I heard that before COVID-19, when people could dine inside, they serve your pizza and cut it with scissors. When I arrived in Charlottesville for my week-long getaway my friends started asking me if I've been to Lampo yet.

You can imagine the energy that was created towards Lampo at this point. The bar was raised even higher with some of the hurdles that came about before finally getting a pie. The odd Wednesday - Saturday hours meant I had to wait till halfway through the week to try it. After I ordered online I saw there was going to be a 90-minute wait til it would ready.

That's Chicago deep-dish level of preparation time here.

Don't worry, it was worth every single moment it to for me to get a pie.

It was indeed the freshest Neopolitan/Italian style pizza I've ever had.

I'm not a fan of red sauce on my pizza and seeing a pie that was more traditional with the little pieces of cheese spread out made me skeptical but I LOVED their robust tomato sauce. The little saucers of mozzarella were nothing less than amazing. While I would have like a larger portion of the meat-oriented toppings of my Diavola, they complemented what was a simple yet well-executed dish.

The Margherita DOC is everything I want and more. The fungi is also a solid choice and I also peruse the specials menu for a fun change of pace. I love Lampo's crust because it's thin and yet so chewy. I sneak the crust with charred bits for extra flavor. Pro tip: save the leftover meatball sauce and dip the crust in it.

I came here with a friend one weekday evening. The place is kinda small so not good for groups. We sat at the 'bar' and could see the oven in the back. They have hooks underneath the counter to hang your belongings.

We ordered a pizza and each had a glass of red wine. Pizza and wine was amazing, but how long it took to get our pizza was not. It took about an hour for us to get the pizza and there really wasn't that many people eating in. But man was the pizza delicious. Fresh dough flavorful toppings. The wine pairing was phenomenal as well, one of the best I've had.

Stuff here is on the pricier side, but the quality is there. Maybe it was a one off on how long it took to get our food.

Abby S.,4/6/23 20:45,2,0,0,3,5,"I cannot emphasize how good Lampo is. I showed up 15 minutes before they opened and the line was already starting up, so I knew I was in for some great food! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful in picking out what we wanted from the menu, and the food came wickedly fast. 

The brussels sprouts are a can't miss. The dressing is delicious and zesty, and the hazelnuts are the perfect complement. And of course, you can't go wrong simply dumping a pile of freshly grated parmesan on anything. The main event of course is the pizza. We tried two: the Margherita D.O.C. and the Prosciutto. The difference between the classic and the D.O.C. is in the cheese, the classic is the house mozzarella and the D.O.C. is imported straight from Italy. I am sure both are amazing, but the D.O.C. did have an unbeatable creamy and buttery texture that was perfect on the pizza. The Prosciutto was an incredible bite. The meyer lemon perfectly complemented the arugula and other ingredients. The staff brought over fresh parm and red pepper flakes as well, and that added a great kick.

And if you go here, do NOT miss the ricotta donuts. They are perfectly soft inside, with a delicious crunch. They're also served with meyer lemon, and that squeeze cuts through the richness to create a perfect bite. I swear, everything I ate here was better than the last. I cannot wait to return, and in the meantime I have ordered from their takeout a few times!",452,92,baYuuCRzwgHn2BAFc7qodA,"State College, PA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=baYuuCRzwgHn2BAFc7qodA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/j_i6FIH7A7CDqCQcQjYQ0A/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=

Laurel M.,12/21/23 13:57,0,0,0,0,5,"Absolutely incredible and a must-go-to establishment! We visited this intimate and charming restaurant as it was one of the few places open late with a full menu and drinks. 
When we arrived we were greeted and seated quickly right inside the door. The space is small yet vibrant and cozy and we immediately felt at home despite being from out of town. The pizza selection - all Neapolitan style, perfectly sized for yourself or sharing if you're generous - was delightful. A flavor profile and taste for every palette, with local and exotic farm-sourced ingredients. 
After ordering beautifully made cocktails (again with the most considerate ingredients and combinations), our pizzas arrived. While I don't recall the name of mine it was the ""spicy"" one, with a beautiful simple red sauce that was perfect, complete with amazing dollops of cheese and a beautiful chili oil to round out the flavor and texture. 
I love leftovers and I try to eat mindfully most of the time but all of that was out the window here because the pizza was THAT GOOD. I couldn't stop and ate the entire thing with pride. Perfectly flavored crust was cooked to perfection with salty blisters on the edge. The center was paper thin yet cooked and held the simple sauce and cheese perfectly, making you cradle it just so as you prepared for a bite. Slicing the pizza with the fun pizza scissors they give you was also a blast and something I've never done before!

We were in Charlottesville for 4 days and every day I wanted to go back here and sadly we were unable. I still think about this pizza often and crave it - that's how perfect it was! If it wasn't a 7 hr drive away, I'd be here every week.

It was above average but not very memorable. We decided to split a pizza and a sandwich.  The muffaletta had good quality meats and cheeses. The flavors were on point, but the bread was a pita like style, and I don't think it helped the sandwich. The real star of the night is the pizza. The 5 start review is for the pizza. It was great! We had the standard margarita with scissors to cut it. The crust had the correct amount of char and was cooked to give it a nice chew. The quality of the ingredients was clearly on display.  Great sauce with bright tomato mixing with the creamy cheese. Just enough basil to add a little extra on those bites. It was very bright and left me wanting to order another for later. The place is small and seems to be a team effort for service. It was busy, and I think the service suffered a bit.

Lampos more than met my expectations for what pizza should be - delicious texture on the crust, flavorful ingredients.  We enjoyed a nice bottle of red to accompany the meal.  I opted for the prosciutto pizza (mainly bc I love arugula on a pizza).  It was everything I was looking for and more - the lemon added a nice brightness to the taste.  We arrived at 5:30 and didn't have to wait as we snagged the last open table.  After that there was a wait but they serve drinks next door while you're waiting. The pizza was ready maybe 10 minutes after we ordered so you don't have to worry about waiting long once you're seated.  I want to go back and check out the fungi pizza next.

The pizza was amazing because I love mushrooms and the crust had the perfect pull and char.  That chop salad was equally delicious with absolutely no complaints.  I thought that I didn't have enough salad dressing, but it was the perfect amount actually.  

The donuts are a MUST try.  They look funny, but looks are deceiving.  I can't remember how many came with the order because I basically inhaled them.  They were a little crunchy on the outside with the cinnamon and sugar while super soft on the inside!  Delicious!  I don't want regular donuts anymore.  I want some more!.

The staff are very friendly (our waitress gave us some great recommendations for other spots to eat and explore), and the vibe is warm and inviting. 

Food-wise, we started with a small meat & cheese board (loved their homemade bread on that!) and the meatballs in pomodoro sauce (super flavorful and juicy), then we split the DOC Margherita pizza, which was absolutely perfect (chewy crust, deep flavor, extremely fresh, and fun to cut with pizza scissors). We ended with the chocolate pudding, which was surprisingly elevated and unique - the pudding was rich and had a sweet cream mixed in to tone it down a bit, then it was topped with hazelnuts and crunchy caramelized sugar... incredible.

Mark C.,6/20/24 16:31,0,0,0,0,3,"I have waited several days to write this review to see if my disappointment has tempered and dissipated somewhat.  It has; I have decided to go from two stars to three.  

Our first taste of Lampo was when it opened ten years ago.  It was wonderful.  Lampo rivaled anything you could find in Brooklyn, LA or New York City that was modestly priced and of good quality.  The pizzas were superb.  The food was obviously prepared by individuals who loved their craft.  

Our recent experience in June of this year was the first one since the pandemic.  Not the same.  Ingredients still good by and large but the love is missing.  I should add that the staff was never really top notch.  Outside of Brooklyn, LA and the City you don't often find professional servers and that's the case at Lampo.  However, the food more than made up for it.  

I've seen this happen often.   Young, talented people initially motivated to bring quality to the dining experience soon flag after about seven  years because restaurant work is tough.  I know.  My family started our first pizzeria in 1951.  One of my first memories was going with my mother to Brooklyn to buy a Blodgett pizza oven.  (Wood-fired ovens were still in future in this country.)

On a positive note, I hope and think they can recover.  Take my advice: Don't let the crowds of ""thirty somethings"" fool you; they still go to Taco Bell.  Set your own standards, put your nose to the grind stone and make this your life.  There can be no compromise with good food and devotion to hard work.",3,0,xzjhHDU3Ig3Giu5Uz-1zzQ,"Scottsville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xzjhHDU3Ig3Giu5Uz-1zzQ,,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=

First the vibe inside is great - a lot of energy and just fun.   Second - we ordered the white mushroom pizza off the menu and it was very good - not great (could have used more toppings).  Unfortunately the third element was the porchetta sandwich- made with pizza dough, with very tasteful and well prepared broccoli rabe - but devoid of the namesake roasted pork!   Now it was a bit dark inside, so I could not see perfectly but the sandwich was essentially rabe and cheese - well flavored but some porchetta would have been a nice touch.

Jean D.,8/29/24 21:52,0,0,0,0,3,"I will start by saying I really like Lampo. We try to hike up in Raphine once a year and we always stop at Lampo on our way back home to Chesapeake  - it has become a little tradition. 
We went yesterday and I was a bit disappointed.  
I'll start with service. Waitress was a bit cold.  Not very friendly. I usually don't care about that.  I go for the food and servers can have bad days. But when the food is off AND the service... then I mention it in the review. 
Now on to the food. 
The Margherita pizza is my favorite but this time had barely any cheese on it. I feel like I paid 19 dollars for sauce and bread. When I mentioned how the cheese was lacking, the waitress said "" I can bring you some grated cheese"". Not really what I was hoping for, but I said ok. 
To add insult to injury ... the bill came and I was charged 2 dollars for the grated cheese.  On top of the 19 dollar  ""sauce bread"". Really Lampo? Who does that??!! 
You serve pizza. Cheese comes with pizza!!! 
Not cool. 
The olives are also one of my favorite dishes. Ordered that too - no complaints there. The ginger beer was very refreshing. 
But the ending was the kicker. We asked for TWO separate checks. We were a party of three. Waitress told us it couldn't be done. But told us we could figure out who owed what and could use two separate cards for one bill. ( how is that any easier?) So now we had to pull out a calculator and itemize all our charges including the taxes and service charges and the added tip.

While I arrived around opening, getting in was not a speedy process, and indeed it was a half hour past opening before I finally had a pizza (that spends ninety seconds in the oven), which matters because I was hungry from my hike.

However, an excellent shredded kale appetizer sated my hunger, and the quality was there. A DOC margherita, with imported buffalo mozzarella, was only a small increase in price from the basic one, and buffalo mozzarella is hard to find. The crust had a fine note of char, and was easily cut with their fancy pizza scissors.

This menu included a few other intriguing options and they do offer pizzas without cheese for those in need, but I was not disappointed that I picked the standard by which Neapolitan pizzas are judged, and you'd go a long way before you find another such pizza at this level of quality.",4152,519,iJ97UrvPlGNttp44qsJ-4A,"Roanoke, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=iJ97UrvPlGNttp44qsJ-4A,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TYB4VJSrlBAPAgWfZdlN5Q/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lampo-charlottesville?hrid=
