1,,"Thuy H.","2016-12-23 03:44:05",0,0,0,2,4,"This place is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Charlottesville. It's a cute restaurant located in downtown Charlottesville. The restaurant gives off a hipster vibe and the ambiance is memorable. If you go at night on a day with good weather, definitely sit outdoors. This restaurant is a good place for dates! 

The food is always a hit whenever I eat here. Every time I go, I order the green curry with chicken. The curry here is amazing- I've never had such good thai curry before in my life. The sauce has the perfect consistency. It's not overly liquidity, but it's just right. You can really taste the curry paste and the spices in the sauce. Also, the chicken isn't dry, which is something that's difficult to get right. In addition, I got to try the avocado spring rolls when my friend ordered them. It's nothing special but it tasted fresh. 

This restaurant is also my go-to when I'm ordering food during long group meetings for projects. The quality of food is still the same for take-out!",222,186,Cq2vPctREBBQGHlEAypzqg,"New York, NY",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Cq2vPctREBBQGHlEAypzqg,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/CGf7P4ohCKA1IOw6UV7HrA/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/monsoon-siam-charlottesville?hrid=

Pad Thai with Chicken, spice level 2. A little over-garnished with bean sprouts but after I moved them to the side and dug in, it was delicious. And unlike many Thai restaurants, there was a setting of spices right there if I wanted to kick it up a bit. Good texture and the noodles were done to the right al dente. Lots of flavor, lots of chicken that was cooked right. I would only say that there was a bit too much sauce mixed through the noodles.

I had a nice seat at the bar (it's a full bar!) and could see a little bit into the kitchen, working very hard. It's a nice restaurant, that is a converted house.

Very busy and perhaps they were a little short staffed for the lunch rush, but everyone was pleasant and trying.

I had the Ka Pow with chicken and it was delicious as always!! Just spicy enough that I enjoy the heat; some of my coworkers thought it was super hot so fair warning for you if you're not crazy about spicy food. This time it was a tad saltier than usual, but the white rice in the side helped take care of that. 
Since I was starving I ordered the spring rolls and wasn't overly impressed they seemed over fried and super greasy with no real flavor or substance inside :/ 
They were out of the crying tiger.... which I'm not sure how... since it's also a delicious staple here; but alas some new coworkers couldn't try it. 
The service here isn't great... so be prepared for some waiting for drinks, beer and to order... but the server is really nice and the food is great!!!

Tom Yum soup- great flavor, chicken was tender, a little spicy but it was to add a little kick which I enjoyed (normally don't enjoy spicy).

Pad Thai- delicious, great amount of sauce of it and cooked really well, peanut taste wasn't too strong which I appreciated. This tied for favorite dish with the one below.

Pad See Eaw- sooo yummy, noodles were a great texture and capture all the sauce, highly recommend.

Ka Pow- got it with beef and it was my friends favorite part of the meal (we shared it all), spicy but can still taste all the different flavors.

(This was my first time there) 

The waitress I had was vegetarian and actually super helpful in regards to vegan options. She said right up front that they could make pretty much anything without fish sauce. When I asked for the spice tray she showed me which was fish sauce so I'd know. 


As far as the actual food, I love love loved my fresh rolls and I got ""pad cashew nut"" which came with rice. Absolutely delicious and the spices on the spice tray were the best I've had. 

Great portion size in my opinion. 

One negative was that the fryer was broken so we couldn't have any fried tofu or spring rolls or anything. Hopefully this was just a fluke and they get it fixed soon. I didn't knock them down a star for it because sometimes unforseeable things happen.

My friends kept saying that the food here was excellent so I finally went with them to try it out. 

The place itself is super cute; I really loved the hanging lights and atmosphere. It was pretty popping for a Sunday night (when we came) but service was great the whole night. Even when we messed up on how to split the check the servers were really patient and kind (forgive us!). 

The food itself was super solid! I got a beef pad see ew and really loved the flavor. The noodles were just the right texture and the beef wasn't too fatty. Will say that I didn't really enjoy the mostly stems that were used instead of actual broccoli flowers, but everything else was tasty.

8,,"Drew V.","2019-02-12 17:08:11",0,0,0,0,3,"Only thing not average about Monsoon Siam was the price.

Ordered spring rolls, they were okay. Very crispy so 1/4 of the shell breaks off when you go to eat them.

Would have preferred duck sauce over the sweet and sour sauce they used.

Was in the mood for fried rice, did a chicken and beef chicken fried rice. Charged for full beef, even though I didn't receive ""double meat"" portions. Not a big deal but when your bill is $35 for 2 basic entrees & 4 spring rolls sort of makes you wonder.

The fried rice was not bad, it was very bland. Gordon Ramsey would say that chef mike made it, you know.. the microwave.

I don't actually think they microwave their food, just that the fried rice was bland.

Hard spot to get to, if the town is busy best bet is to park in the open lot near the restaurant or up further at the east market parking garage -- this would be a bit of a hike though.

The Pad Thai is pretty good but my favorite dish here is the Kao Soi with softshell crab. That dish was the perfect combination of crunchy, spicy, and flavorful and one that I very much enjoyed.

Outdoor seats give you a perch over the Market street climb toward 2nd street. Metal patio seats of a harder bench, bossa nova, and melody gardot in the background. An empty patio quickly filled on a Tuesday night with smiling diners.

The thai food was good. We planned to stray from the curries, but the waiter, when asked, insisted twice the curries were fresh made.   Green and red curries were flavorful.  Maybe not top notch all times, but among top rank in charlottesville.  Asked if I could 'tolerate spice' in the green curry, yea.  Hardly thai heat, more an american summer--If seeking ask for more.

The beef salad was a proper one and recommended.

11,,"Casey S.","2019-06-11 00:20:57",0,0,0,0,4,"I'm a big fan of this restaurant for casual dinners in Charlottesville. It offers a widely varied menu of Asian specialties with unique twists and plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. The fresh rolls are my favorite things to order as an appetizer each time - they're stuffed with avocado that's fresh and creamy, and the peanut sauce it's served with is to DIE for. The first time I went, I ordered the rama tofu, which was smothered in the peanut sauce that I loved, but hard to eat with only the spoon I was provided with, and a bit pricey at $14. Next time I got a tofu and veggie sautee, which was delicious, yet quite a small portion for $10. 

The venue is also a positive. It has a beautiful outdoor dining area under string lights to enjoy in warm weather. The inside is clean and tasteful too, yet a big cramped and dark. I settled on four stars mostly due to menu pricing and inside atmosphere.

My favorite dish there is the duck noodles-- you have to try it! The cigar rolls are also pretty unique-- kind of like an Indian samosa in spring roll format. 

Curries are solid, though a little soupier than other Thai restaurants I've been to. I have also tried their Kao Soi with soft shelled crab. The crab was great and the dish looked really cool, but I felt like all the dry noodles on top were a little distracting from the egg noodles in the soup that I wanted to get to! 

One thing this place could work on is their service. Both times I've been to eat on their patio the servers are super aloof and the meal has taken way longer than it should have.

Following the hype about Monsoon I've been wanting to taste it. I ordered the Kao Soi, that is a dish I never ordered in the past at any Thai restaurant, to my demise, the broth was lacking that flavor, spike, punch  that that dish can provide your taste buds. 

I also ordered the mango  sticky rice  and unfortunately was not great, I mean it was ok for somebody that has never eaten that dish before. 

The rice was overdone, lacking flavor.

Their noodles are cooked to perfection, great balance between not to soft and not to hard - a perfect level of chewiness to it. Everything about this dish has been consistent each time I've ordered it. A couple other dishes to comment on: their drunk noodles were too salty and greasy for my liking, their papaya salad also too salty, kinda lacked sweetness. I usually get their food thai hot, but end up adding more red pepper to my dish. 

A couple problems I've run into: parking - I wish it was more ample, and their lack of response phone calls. I've almost given up on take out because they don't answer their phones. Although I will say, I've never had a problem with service when I dine in.

Parking: street parking, can be a little challenging. We parallel parked a block away. 

Vibe: outdoor seating with a cute date night vibe. Pretty heat lamps. Perfect for a night out. 

Food: I got the massaman curry and it was very good. The chicken was super tender and the flavor of the curry was amazing. Only suggestion-have them chop up the peanuts and sprinkle on top instead of leaving them whole. My husbands Pad Thai was good too but we agreed the curry was better. We had the mango sticky rice for desert and that was on par for the best mango sticky rice I have had. 

Wait time: We sat down at 6 and it wasn't very crowded, however, by 7, every outdoor table was taken! Unfortunately our food took 30-40 minutes to come out since they were packed and it seems like they get a ton of takeout orders that they have to prepare. It was odd because the people next to us put their order in after ours and got their food a solid 20 min before us. Maybe it depends on what you order or they forgot to put our order in- who knows.

You can taste when fresh ingredients are used and they definitely don't go to waste here! I ordered the garlic chicken and added baby corn and it was mildly spicy.

Now for the food. Let me start with 10/10! The Ka Pow was such a good spice! Had a kick but still good enough to eat and enjoy. My partner got the Pad Thai and he loved it too.

First, it's a bit off the Main Street so you might be tempted to not go there... but Main Street means more price for not always better quality... so check one box. And it did not disappoint my large group of family - almost every dish we ordered was tasty in that authentic Thai way and service was also prompt. 
We had kids from toddler to teen ages and they all went silent eating, and all the adults were sharing and enjoying. 
Just to highlight a few, my Hai Yat noodle was absolutely delicious... perfect chewy noodles in savory sauce with tons of fresh delicious seafood. Other winners were pad kee mao (drunken noodle), pad Thai, and crab fried rice.
One minor mistake was when we didn't get the Kao Soi noodle dish because there was misunderstanding and they brought another dish instead which was gingery... but even that, we finished it all so wasn't a big deal. Their Thai iced tea was a tad bit too sweet though. 
Everybody left with a fully belly and we even took a group pic to commemorate our lunch.

Outdoor seating is good and importantly you can take your furry babies. 
A sure try",87,9,YzlhvoVrNtPODdq2dA6AXw,"Chantilly, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YzlhvoVrNtPODdq2dA6AXw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/SJtXFc7mjz-7Yq906-clRg/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/monsoon-siam-charlottesville?hrid=

We got the hat yay noodle, crispy pork noodle, and fresh rolls.

The peanut sauce that goes with the fresh rolls is borderline drinkable and honestly good enough of a reason to order it to begin with. I absolutely love how crunchy and fresh the vegetables are and it's so well-balanced with the creaminess of the avocado.

The crispy texture of the coating on the pork paired really well with the softness of the noodles, and the presentation was immaculate, although the meat tasted a little bit gamey. 

But I think the real star of the show was the hat yay noodles. It was so sweet and savory at the same time, perfectly saucy, and the chewy noodles provided such a great comparison to the crunchy veggies and the outer fried rice paper! The seafood was also a really nice touch.

The interior is super duper cute and I would love to come back on a day trip to try out more of the dishes they have.",136,0,dCvHUJufGBePFPpCAh5uFw,"Los Angeles, CA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dCvHUJufGBePFPpCAh5uFw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/QEPgoT1TYZNFonyHwYDyhg/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/monsoon-siam-charlottesville?hrid=
