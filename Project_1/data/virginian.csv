1,,"J David H.","2013-10-07 17:37:10",0,0,0,2,5,"On only my second visit to the University of Virginia's campus I had an expectation of finding that special UVA haunt where all the college students and professors alike can hang out and share stories over a cold brew.  Not just any place mind you, the atmosphere needed to be unique, cozy and that vibe... well you would only know it when it occurred.  Eureka!!! this is indeed the place and I would recommend The Virginian Restaurant all day long for those wanting the same type of experience.

The wait on a Friday evening was not long, but keep in mind there is not a lot of room to wait.  The manager quickly took my name and gave expectations of a estimated wait time.  There is one bench toward the entrance of the place.  Outdoor seating is also available and awesome for nice weather and being among all the foot traffic. All the tables were wooden booths and bar seating was available too. Not a lot of room in the walk way beside the tables, so keep this in mind if you have any issue with being too cozy.  I LOVED the fact it was this way and it added to the mystique of the place. The restaurant was clean and tables were quickly being bused for patrons waiting.

After about 10 minutes we got a table and a waitress who was new had menus and got drink orders. TV's were all around us for your viewing pleasure. However, I really enjoyed the people watching as we were set by the bar. Our table had chunks of wood chipped out from rowdy college students I suppose. I assume many were this way and I just thought it added to the overall charm of the place. How old were these tables any way... well the restaurant itself it a landmark on campus. Are they original to the 1940's, I am unsure. But the wooden floors, booths and bar was like being in a tavern in old time Williamsburg.

We put in our order, for my son's chicken fingers and my Coal Miner Burger. I also ordered a Pint of Full Nelson Pale Ale during happy hour for a measly $2, which was delicious. Even though our waitress was new she smiled often and was helpful every step of the way. The place was slammed, but you would not have known by her attitude. It did not take anymore than 15 minutes and food was out. We both enjoyed our meals and I was in aw of the taste and price of my burger for $9. The Coal Miner is a 1/2 pounder with bacon and barbecue. It comes with fries too. My son's four large chicken fingers were more than he could handle and they really piled on the fries.  

We struck up a conversation with a couple at the bar about the UVA Football the next day. Yes, you are that close even if seated at a table. They were from Indiana and I too am a native Hooiser. We both had the same thoughts of the restaurant. This is the place if your wanting a nostalgic venue for the many a student who have passed through the front door of The Virginian before you.

Eateries like this are a treasure to find. Engagements occur here regularly, secret societies on campus have activity here, and regular folks like me just breathe this all this in.

I had a ridiculous time at this bar. It was a good mix of us, probably 3 or 4 Tech alums and 3 or 4 UVa alums. I don't remember all that happened, but I know the bartender that was working was the man. He let us take control of the music after 11 PM and get up on the tables and dance.

1) The Famous Virginian Club - I've gotten this twice and wow... the portion sizes are huge. It's like 3 pieces of bread with what seems to be endless pieces of turkey, ham, bacon, tomato, lettuce in between... You get to pick a side too (French fries for me). With the amount of food that I got, it felt like I ate enough to last the entire day. Definitely a place with the largest portions I've been to. Come hungry I suppose! 

2) Some sort of salmon burger, which I do not see on their menu anymore. I would not recommend this. I love salmon and thought this was going to be delectable and amazing... WHAT a disappointment.. The salmon was cooked way too long and tasted like a piece of wood..

5,,"Erin B.","2017-07-11 20:45:23",1,0,0,4,3,"While on my grad school hunt, I wanted to check out UVA since my parents don't live too far away. We only had a few hours in Charlottesville so we came here for lunch.

Prices were decent with most things being in the $10 and below range. The food was good but the service was a bit messy. Waitstaff seemed disorganized which was bad in a space that was already so cramped. It took a while for us to get  menus and drinks but once our food orders went in the food came pretty quickly. I had a grilled cheese sandwich (there weren't a ton of non-meat options) with tomato and as simple as that is, it was a really good grilled cheese. My stepdad had a steak omelette and said it was good. 

From one college town to another, I feel like every campus has at least one restaurant like this where it's a campus 'tradition' or someplace you have to eat at because of the history or because everyone recommends it. At the end of the day it's just another greasy diner. Not to say it was bad, because as far as greasy diner food goes it was pretty good, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.",240,273,H7YVaxQtLIiOvy0-Xu1soA,"Iowa City, IA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=H7YVaxQtLIiOvy0-Xu1soA,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Swf2Ft3LxrrPA72kCAjCRg/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-virginian-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=

7,,"Sean C.","2018-02-01 03:52:22",1,1,1,3,5,"I was in Charlottesville this week for business and scored some tickets to the Louisville vs Virginia basketball game. As a huge sports fan, I jumped at the chance and enjoyed a fun game at John Paul Jones Arena. (Yes, the Cavaliers beat Louisville) 

After the game, many of the undergrads told me to head to ""The Corner"" and experience ""UVA Life."" The majority of the people told me to check out The Virginian...or ""The Virg"" as they called it. What a good suggestion.

I stopped in and grabbed a booth and was immediately greeted by Erin, a vibrant, always-smiling 3rd year. She grabbed me a cold Get Bent IPA and suggested several items off the menu. ""We're known for our Mac & Cheese but I love our Coal Miner burger. The Caesar Wrap is good too.""

After choosing the Coal Miner burger, I sat back and enjoyed my beer while watching the undergrads file in along with some other alums and basketball fans for a local bite before the kitchen closed at 10pm.

Hannah was the other server on tonight and she & Erin were a very impressive team. Hannah had a infectious smile and humble attitude that made you want to leave a bigger tip before she even did anything. They are both the epitome of ""good people"" and anyone who has a son in college at UVA is hoping they find a girl like them. Each of them stopped by my table numerous times to check on me and just chat. They answered my questions and shared stories about ""The Virg"" and their experiences on campus as undergrads and also gave me some ""must see"" sights while in town.

The burger was awesome and served exactly as ordered. The first bite was awesome as the bacon was crispy, the burger was juicy and the bbq sauce was Carolina Sweet. Add in the crispy seasoned fries and the Chris Stapleton songs on the speakers made the entire meals more enjoyable. 

Look, there are lots of places in this town you could eat but if you're looking for something other than a fast food burger or a assembly line burrito, do yourself a favor and enjoy the experience of The Virginian in CVille. Just be sure to ask ""are Erin and Hannah are working tonight."" If they are, grab a seat...and consider buying a lottery ticket because you just had some great luck come your way.

8,,"Kathryn C.","2018-02-14 22:08:06",1,0,0,1,3,"This restaurant is conveniently located on the corner at the University of Virginia. I went here for dinner following a basketball game with my dad and my brother. The menu can only be described as classic American food. 

We ordered the grilled cheese, Virginian burger, and the southwest veggie wrap. I appreciated the addition of vegetarian items to the menu. Overall, the food was good and met my expectations. My dad (who ordered the burger) commented that his burger was very tasty. I ordered the southwest veggie wrap, which was also quite tasty, but was a little soggy due to the dressing/veggies. Based on my experience, I'd say go to the Virginian for a high quality burger. They're also known for having dope Mac' and cheese (although, I can't confirm since I didn't try it). 

This place is also great for not only happy hour, but also beer at any time of day. They have great drink specials always. When I was there they were having a 'two for five dollar' deal, which I found as a great deal for quality product. 

Ambiance is best described (in my opinion) as tavern-style. Laid back waiters and patrons (definitely a stop for some drunk UVA students).

The Virginian is a classic Corner restaurant that offers a variety of American foods with big portions at generous prices. They also offer fantastic drink specials after 7pm every day that I highly recommend checking out.

I came here with some friends looking to get a few drinks and ordered some appetizers. After taking a glance at the dinner menu, the crab cake entree caught my eye and I decided to turn a late afternoon casual visit into an early dinner. I was not disappointed.

All main entrees come with two sides, so my two large lump crab cakes came with a healthy handful of sweet potato fries and a ceramic cup full of mac n cheese, topped with a crispy hash brown. 

The crabcakes themselves were pretty good, though slightly softer and breadier than what I have had in the past. But at $22, I don't think I can expect a 95%+ crab meat serving. The sweet potato fries were hot, crisp, and lightly salted. The mac n cheese is a side the Virginian is famous for and there is an excellent reason for that. If it fits your diet, always select the mac n cheese as a side. 

All in all, the Virginian offers a wonderful casual dining experience at an affordable price with generous portions. If you're on the corner and looking for a wholesome place to grab a bite with some friends, the Virginian should always be a consideration.",13,260,dMX1pre6VeWUn88cBwMYiw,"Charlottesville, VA",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dMX1pre6VeWUn88cBwMYiw,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/gm2FS2tcDaX-oS-3WFQMRg/180s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-virginian-restaurant-charlottesville?hrid=

The menu is nothing more spectacular than typical bar food, but all dishes are done well and offered at a reasonable price. My favorite item off the menu is the mac n cheese, which is creamy and delicious, topped with a crispy hash brown. Additional common menu items like quesadillas, burgers, sandwiches, and fries are all served at a higher quality than most competitors, and everything they serve is enjoyable! 

The restaurant is also a well known for its bar, which has different drink specials every day of the week. At night time (typically after around 11pm after the kitchen is closed), the restaurant converts into a full bar. They play great music (with playlists filled with crowd-pleasing throwbacks), encouraging people to dance on tables and have a great time.

14,,"Paul P.","2018-09-22 01:16:22",0,0,0,0,1,"This seemed to be a great place to go grab a drink. As for the food, my meal was horrible, and service was subpar (at best).

I had the 'famous' mac & cheese as a appetizer. It was very very bland and made me ponder on what was so famous about it anyway???

For dinner, I had the crab cake sandwich. The bun seemed hard / old, the crabcake was properly cooked, but again very very bland. The arugula sauce did not have the kick that one would expect and did not add any enhancements to the flavor profile. With that being said, I had to share mine sauce with someone else at my table as they did not receive their container of arugula sauce with their cab cake sandwich. We would of asked for more but we had to ask for multiple other missing items beforehand, and it was few and far between when we saw our waitress.

For my sides I had fries which were not bad (maybe packaged season fries???)

My other side was french onion soup... I finally figured where they were storing all of their spices!!!!!! They should reconsider renaming this soup as salt onion soup. I LOVE french onion soup and order it almost every time I see it on menu. This is hands down the absolute worst french onion soup that I unfortunately have tried. All you could taste is salt... nothing else.. I could not finish it with fear of having a stroke, and it was just god awful bad.

Then after patiently waiting for our bill (once again feeling forgotten about by our waitress), we asked her to split the bill and kindly told her who had what (because she really did forget). Her world still seemed somewhat rocked having to do this.

She then came back with out respective bills and of course did not have it right. I ended up with all the appetizers. I ended up just paying for them all because I was beyond done with this place by then, and had places to go.

To my understanding this is Charlottesville's oldest restaurant. From older reviews that I read this seemed to once be upstanding place to eat at. I would imagine that either ownership has changed, management, cooking staff, and/or recipes/ingredients... Maybe all of above??? 

Needless to say the only thing keeping this place a float is it's location and bar. As it stands I will never go back for food unless some serious changes are made.

For appetizer we got the spinach and artichoke with pita bread and it was really good! The dip was made in house and had a pretty decadent flavor. For our mains I got the grilled cheese sandwich with fries and my boyfriend got their Virginian burger. The sandwich was decent, but a little dry - nothing life changing. Fries were seasoned well. My boyfriend ordered his burger to be medium rare but it came out medium-well. He didn't complain as the burger as a whole was really good.

The ribs were SO tender and really fantastic. You could barely touch them with your fork and the meat just falls off the bone leaving it flawlessly clean. Delicious!

The mac-n-cheese, which this place is apparently known for, was really underwhelming. It was creamy, but it had almost no flavor. Just tasted like a bowl of creamy noodles, lacking cheesy flavor/boldness, and also didn't have enough salt. The potato cake fritter thing on top was dense and also flavorless - ours tasted overcooked or perhaps not fresh. 
The sweet potato fries were meh. 
The French onion soup wasn't super hot and was just OK.

In hindsight, I should have known better than to order crab cakes... I wonder if people outside of the Chesapeake know what a crab cake is supposed to be?  Crab cakes are shaped like mounds, with discernable - preferably large - chunks of crab inside, off-white in color.  What I received was as if someone thought a crab cake was a hamburger patty made of crab - ground up crab meat (I'll assume it was crab, though I saw nothing that would resemble a lump of crab), flat like a burger of ground meat, gray in color (I have no idea how this even comes to be), slightly charred, and bland.  This is not a crab cake.   This is reconstituted pureed crab.

Moving on, the french onion soup was passable, would have been better with an ample amount of cheese, as it had a deli slice of swiss thrown on top.

Mac & Cheese was fine, not sure why it is famous, and I didn't read the menu carefully enough to know that it was topped with a ""house-made cheddar potato cake.""  At first glance I saw it and thought it was a fried green tomato, but sadly it was not.  I'm not mad at the potato cake, but it did nothing to enhance the mac & cheese, and was like a carb overload.  

On the plus side, service was polite, the atmosphere was buzzing, and ...well... that's it.

Last but not least, when you calculate tip, it should be on pre-tax dollars.  Including the tax in the tip in your suggested tip is dishonest and anyone who doesn't check your math is being ripped off.

Servers all seem to be young UVa students which is a good thing. They are friendly and attentive.

-grilled chicken salad
-steak and cheese w/fries
-crabcake sandwich with side salad & mac & cheese
-french onion soup

Portions are pretty big except for the steak and cheese. That was on the smaller side. 

Crabcake is ok...not packed with crab, lots of filler...meh

Salad is decent.
