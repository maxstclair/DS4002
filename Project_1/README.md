## Reproduction Instructions
1. Open project 1 folder: this contains all documents for the text data project 
2. Open scripts folder: contains all scripts
   - Documents are labeled steps 0-2 to indicate the order in which they were            produced. 
   - Ignore cleaning documents, unless interested in seeing how data was combined        from individual restaurants. 
4. Locate and open 2.1_Analysis - Project 1 MI3 analysis: this document contains code for all relevant analyses performed. .1 indicates it is the combined script to be executed.
   - It is a combination of the EDA and Rating Sentiment regression script, the          seasonality analysis script and the word sentiment analysis script. These           scripts are coded 2.0 to indciate they came before.
   - Follow the comments outlined in the document which take you through the             various analyses.
   - The age regression script produced no meaningful results, but if interested in      following that logic, open the age regression script.
